Scientists are a notoriously cloistered lot.  We're here in our ivory tower, publishing our research for each other.  This is an old model that has been going on for generations.

But here we are in the "information age" - can we do better?  Rather than fight it out in the journals, argue in the dark corners of meetings, and have paradigms evolve and shift as slowly as the review process grinds onwards - why not open up the ivory tower and let the free-for-all of ideas, thoughts, and opinions shoot ahead at full speed?  [ I think this is where we need to go](http://www.esa.org/esablog/?p=21).

[![After a good long working dive, there's nothing I like to do more than blog it.  Immediately.](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/jarrett-byrnes-field-ecologist_1024-300x225.jpg)](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/jarrett-byrnes-field-ecologist_1024.jpg)

So who am I to be so presumptuous?  I'm a [marine community ecologist](http://byrneslab.net) who, by guilt of association with a [variety](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/) [of](http://pith.org/notes/) [people](http://www.parenthetical.net/), has long been fascinated with the medium of the 'net and it's possibilities.  I study how biodiversity effects the function of ecosystems, and how the hurly-burly of forces in those ecosystems shapes biodiversity.  (mostly with sea squirts - hence the name - although lately I've been making a journey to the kelpier side)

And what is more diverse with more forms and functions than the web?  So, enjoy what you find here.  I hope it is informative, occasionally silly, and thought provoking.  At the very least, I hope some of my thoughts makes you stop and think about the natural world and our place in it.  At the most, I hope I put a bee in your bonnet, and we can hash out some ideas!
