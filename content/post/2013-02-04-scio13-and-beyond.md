While I've been active in using online spaces for scientific activities - blogging, [tweeting](http://twitter.com/jebyrnes), [crowdfunding](http://scifundchallenge.org), and much much more - for a looong time.  I've found it's benefitted me greatly [as a scientist](http://www.slideshare.net/JarrettByrnes/taking-the-ecological-conversation-online).  I've also formed a deep love for the [community](http://deepseanews.com/) [I've](http://theseamonster.net/) [found](http://contemplativemammoth.wordpress.com/) [in](http://neurodojo.blogspot.com/) [the](http://echinoblog.blogspot.com/) [online](http://zenscience.org/blog/) [science](http://www.southernfriedscience.com/) [world](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/) (to name just a few).

And yet, until this year, I'd never been to science online before.

This year, I finally remedied that.  And it was indeed amazing.  I'll be posting the notes from my own session on how science online can and has changed the peer review process, but, I wanted to share this picture of (many) of the marine bloggers who were at the conference, and issue a challenge.

First - the challenge.

HEY MARINE SCIENTISTS WHO READ THIS BLOG (you're quiet, but I see you in my hitlog)!!!  I understand that #SciO13 may have been a bit overwhelming for you, or too broad, or something, so you didn't register.  It's ok.  Becoming more engaged with the science online world can seem like a lot.  But, aren't you a little bit curious?  Well, if you are, in October, David Shiffman is setting up an amazing opportunity for you - [Science Online Oceans](http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=13959).  Go read his post, and block that weekend off on your calendar.  Right now!  Then come to Miami next October, and be prepared to have your world blown open as you interact with a much broader community that will help you realize the full potential of this internet thingamajig and how it can help you as a scientist.

(oh, and everyone reading should consider coming to [Science Online 2014](http://scio14.wikispaces.com/) as well)

And now, the picture, which should serve as some extra enticement.  It's only a few of the marine bloggers who were at the conference, so it's only a small flavor of the awesomeness that was there, and the great connections and conversations that resulted.  But I think you get the point.
