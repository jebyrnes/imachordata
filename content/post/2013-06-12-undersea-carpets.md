The second site of the day was a surprise.  10 years ago, Smith's Cove was a mixed mussel bed and urchin barren.  Previous, it has been a _Codium_ meadow.  Now... It's just a giant red algal carpet.  Wall to wall. Thick, easily fragmenting, ubiquitous, invasive red _Heterosiphonia japonica_.  Also, big tufts of _Ulva_. And some other bushy filamentous algae scattered about, along with a few crabs.

What a weird landscape.  What is that red carpet doing?  Smothering things? Creating habitat for mobile invertebrates? Providing food, or is it not that edible?  The reef was like this as far as we swam and looked around - hundreds of square meters.  Weird.
