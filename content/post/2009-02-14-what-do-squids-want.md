Ah, February 14th.  Couples stroll arm in arm, leaning on one another, exchanging roses and kisses, eating sumptuous dinners, and losing themselves in the moment.  What moment is that, you ask?  Well, it's Squid Orgy Day!

No, really.  Now is the time for squid reproduction, and in this [wonderful piece on Slate](http://www.slate.com/id/2211343/) by Miriam of [The Oyster's Garter](http://theoystersgarter.com/2009/02/13/the-oysters-garter-goes-national/) (yay!  congrats on your national debut!) she lays out six secrets for those squids out there interested in making the "beast with two beaks".

So take note!
