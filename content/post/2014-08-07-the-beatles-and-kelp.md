For a blog post somewhere else, I'm trying to re-work the Beatle's classic _Kelp!_, er, I mean, _Help!_.  But my first draft got all urchin-y.  I love it, though, so I thought I'd post it here.

**KELP! (from the perspective of a growing urchin)**

Kelp! I need some algae.
Kelp! not just any algae
Kelp! You know I need some kelp!

When I was younger (So much younger than) so much younger than today
(I never needed) I never needed any growing kelp in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone), I don't eat just diatoms
(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up my jaws

Kelp me if you can, I'm hungry now
And I do appreciate kelp being 'round
Kelp is great food for me oh right now
Won't you please, please kelp me

(Now) And now my spines have changed in oh so many ways
(My Aristotle's lantern) My Aristotle's lantern is big and ready to graze
(And) And every now (Every now and then) and then I feel so insecure
(I know that I) I know that I just need kelp like I've never needed it before

(chorus)

When I was younger (So much younger than) so much younger than today
(I never needed) I never needed any growing kelp in any way
(Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone), I don't eat just diatoms
(I know I've found) Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up my jaws

Kelp me if you can, I'm hungry now
And I do appreciate kelp being 'round
Kelp is great food for me oh right now
Won't you please, please kelp me, kelp me, kelp me, ooh
