After writing up [my tutorial](http://www.imachordata.com/?p=1123) regarding getting WinBUGS running on a Mac in R, a friend sent me [this fantastic simple tutorial](http://www.davideagle.org/r-2/running-openbugs-on-mac-using-wine) on the same thing for OpenBUGS on a mac in R.  So, for those that want it, install away!  Looks a good bit simpler, actually!
