I just learned that [Lawrence Slobodkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_B._Slobodkin) passed away last week.  Slobodkin was one of the authors of the infamous [HSS](http://www.ecoplexity.org/files/Hairston%20et%20al,%201960.pdf) paper in 1960 that has shaped how we think of the role of predators in ecosystems for decades.  Indeed, it is one of the very origins of the modern concept of [trophic cascades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_cascade).  More than that, though, this was a man with broad ranging interests in biology.  I think the [New York Times Obit](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/nyregion/22slobodkin.html?ref=science) has some interesting points about his contribution to our understanding of the world, and includes this quote from Slobodkin:

<blockquote>Sometimes I chose research problems for their presumed importance, but often I was attracted by their beauty. My research and that of most of my friends is not a story of triumph but rather of fascination by nature.</blockquote>

A good model for us all.
