One of the great things about field stations is the silliness they engender.  I mean, there you are, in the middle of nowhere, with no one but other scientists thinking about the wonder of the natural world.  Awe and wonder can only take you so far.  And then, at some point, you cross over, and start to get a little silly.

It leads to things like dressing up as fouling panels, launching serious plans to make an 'underwater office,' elaborate nail-polish-marking designs for crab carapaces, and no small number of pranks.

And then, there's this.  This may be on the order of the silliest things ever to come out of field station.  I heard the gull interns (seagull science is notorious for producing silliness alongside great science) talking about this idea to sync some of their videos up with the Les Mis soundtrack and now...now I found they've... well..

You must see this to believe it.  Astounding.  My hats off to the SML 2013 Gull crew.  Marine science music video of the year?

(also, who is singing on 'I dreamed a dream' - amazing voice!)
