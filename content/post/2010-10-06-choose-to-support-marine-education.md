It's that time of year where we ocean bloggers band together for the cause of Marine Environmental Education in US Schools.  Between now and Nov 9th, we're running a drive through Donor's Choose in order to indoctrinate educate schoolkids in the wonders of the sea.  Last year was a huge success, bringing in thousands of dollars to underfunded schools and enabling some real discovery.  This donation is tax deductible, so, please, make a difference and donate (anything!  every dollar counts!) to one of the projects over at our [donor's choose site](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=74587).  And a big thanks for the folk over at [Deep Sea News](http://deepseanews.com/) for setting this up!
