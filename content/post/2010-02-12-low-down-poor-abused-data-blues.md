I'm having one of those days.  One of those "I have a meeting that will finalize the analyses for a paper, let's just check that ONE thing that didn't matter in early versions of this model, so, it shouldn't matter now, and OMGWTFBBQ everything changed!" kinds of days.  Well, OK, not everything - just the new piece of the story that intrigued me the most because it was so delightfully intuitive.  It's made me feel a little blue.  Well, a lot blue.  So, fingers flying across the keyboard to fit new models, I flipped on some Muddy Waters.  At the same time [Miriam G](http://www.oystersgarter.com) suggested the _Low Down Poor Abused Data Blues_.  While I'm no Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, or BB King, clearly, this must be done.  I've got a first verse.  I'm welcome to contributions:[caption id="" align="alignright" width="175" caption="This is me.  Right now.  Except replace the guitar with a laptop furiously churning through R code."]

**Low Down Poor Abused Data Blues**

Oh my data's got autocorrelation,
eats up my treatment effect.

But the decrease in sample size, it makes my analysis such a wreck.
