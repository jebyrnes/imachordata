Happy [Half Tau Day](http://halftauday.com/) to everyone!  What's that, you say?  It's Pi Day?  Whatever.  π is wrong.  Need convincing?  See the brilliant video by [Vi Hart](http://vihart.com/) below and visit [The Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/).

So go out there, and celebrate the fact that you're halfway to the day where you can make 2 Pi!

(And don't worry, you should still make some π today!  It's delicious!)
