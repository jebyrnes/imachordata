For the fashionable marine biologist:  Some months back, I fell upon a website called [Sir Critter](http://sircritter.com/) selling t-shirts of organisms bedecked by a monocle, top-hats, and cane.  I asked the designer if he would create a Sir Sea Squirt.  He was delighted, and just posted the resulting shirt, [Sir Sea Squirt](http://sircritter.com/design/sirseasquirt/).

For those of you out there who don't think Sea Squirts are, indeed, the coolest thing on earth.  [*ahem*](http://scienceblogs.com/deepseanews/2008/03/invertebrate_battle_royal_roun.php)  They also have [Sir Urchin](http://sircritter.com/design/sirurchin/) (I'm getting one with a purple _S. purpuratus_), [Sir Squid](http://sircritter.com/design/sirsquid/), [Sir Jellyfish](http://sircritter.com/design/sirjellyfish/), [Sir Sea Slug](http://sircritter.com/design/sirseaslug/), and more.  The designer has also mentioned that he'll be updating with a few new critters every month.
