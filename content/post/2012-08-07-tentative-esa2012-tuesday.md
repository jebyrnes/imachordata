Tuesday looks to be pretty exciting.  The number of overlapping talks all of which I want to see has jumped up, and, heck, there are overlapping symposia that I could sit through.  That said, I THINK this is going to be my schedule...again, just posting it for myself, but feel free to browse (loading this page on ye olde smartphone and using it to navigate was wicked convenient today).

If there is one talk to see today, in my opinion, it's the 10:50 COS 36-9 talk by Pamela Reynolds.  She'll be talking about the results from the global scale [Zostera Experimental Network](http://zenscience.org/) (ZEN) in D139, and I, for one, am really excited to see those results!

So, schedule
SYMP 4 - The Two Cultures of Statistics In Ecology: Prediction Vs. Explanation Portland Ballroom 251 starting at 8 - really, I could go to this whole thing.  And I might.  But...in case I don't, other individual talks for the morning -
