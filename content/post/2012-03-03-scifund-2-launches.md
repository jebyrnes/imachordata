That's right, folk, last time we had 49 scientists bring in ~1400 people to check out their hot science and fund it to the tune of $76,000.  And that was when we had no idea what we were doing.  And now it's time for round 2!  We're going to have a little more community review, some training, and we have a whole boatload of lessons learned.

So if you're a scientist who wants to crowdfund their research, go and [sign up!](http://scifund.wordpress.com/sign-up/)  And if you want to learn more, [check out the project blog.](http://scifund.wordpress.com/blog/)

Because it's on!
