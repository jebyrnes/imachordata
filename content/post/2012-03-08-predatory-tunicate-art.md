To bring the blog back to its tunicate-y roots, here's an AWESOME piece of predatory tunicate art from [Noctorunal Sea](http://nocturnalsea.deviantart.com/art/Predatory-Tunicate-281578373).  They say they'll have it up as at [this webstore soon](http://www.nocturnalsea.com/Webstore.html).  I know what I'm gettin' for my office wall next!
