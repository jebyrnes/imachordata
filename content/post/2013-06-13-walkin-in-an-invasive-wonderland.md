Last day of dives before heading back.  We hit two sites on either side of the northern head of Appledore.  It's a remarkable break, as on one side you have fairly decent expsore to waves from the West.  On the other, things are fairly protected.  So, there's a strong physical gradient.  And, though perhaps just a few hundred meters apart, the two sites could not be more different.  At the first site, the photos didn't come out terribly well, but this gives you a general sense -

![It was Halosiphon as far as the eye could see - like diving in a bed of furry ropes.  Or very thin muppet arms.  No, wait, that's just odd... although it would fit nicely in  Dark Crystal or Labyrinth.](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DSCN0086-1024x768.jpg)

Lots of adorable cunner swimming about, but, man, churned up.  A little _Heterosiphonia_ about, but, not too bad.

Then we rounded the corner.  And saw...

It's like somebody defauntated the rumpus room and decided to give the entire subtidal a nice shag carpet.  I mean, sure, it hides the stains, but...

More than that, the site was quite bouldery.  But what invertebrates were on the boulders?

Oh, look!  It's my old friend _Didemnum vexillum_ from the Left Coast.  It's here, in force.  I've seen spots of it all week, but, nothing like the giant area covering colonies of the Bodega Harbor jetty or the docks.  And yet, here it is.  Sure, there's some _Desmerestia_ thrown in for good measure, but, more or less, it's all invasives, all the time down here.

What is going on?  How long will this state last?
