I'm so excited.  It's one of my favorite times of year.  That's right, it's time for the Annual Chemical Ecology Music Video Festival!  Oh, [J. Long](http://www.3dmatt.com/drlong/), what have your students [cooked up this time](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4B5191CF4E4FB022&feature=plcp)?

Pure awesomeness, that's what.  This year's crop features a number of epic ballads, rap superstars, and more.  I think I'll highlight my current two favorites, but you should definitely go [check out the whole bunch](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4B5191CF4E4FB022&feature=plcp) or go back and revisit [last year's](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC5A1D0FE53F50662&feature=plpp) (particularly [Under the Boat (featuring K. Hovel)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uBYSx01z8g)).

First off, we have the Lobster Rock Anthem, about _Aplysia californica's_ crazy [chemical defense](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2008.06.008) (pdf) against lobster predation.  I think this group is fantastic - clever lyrics and great style.

And then the award for best costuming goes to...Key Mesograzers.  A rhapsody on Hay et al.'s 1987 [classic](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939849)

Great work, all!  Can't wait to see what they cook up next year!
