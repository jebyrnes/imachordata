I can only assume that the authors of the every silly [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](http://www.smbc-comics.com/) have taken invertebrate zoology and were fascinated by the bizarre life history cycles of trematodes and/or spent some time hanging around with [Armand Kuris and Kevin Lafferty](http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/labs/kuris/) at UC Santa Barbara.  Why?  Because of [today's brilliant comic](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2331#comic) (see below).

**Update:** apparently the [author's wife](http://www.weinersmith.com/) is IN the Kuris lab.  Ha!
