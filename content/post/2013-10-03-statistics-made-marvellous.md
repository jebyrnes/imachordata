You all know I'm one for silly science videos.  And silly statistics videos?  Well, that's like catnip to me.

But today my postdoc Alison introduced me to [Dancing Statistics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFjaBh12C6s&list=PLCkLQOAPOtT2H1hJRUxUYOxThRwfVI9jI).  And it is lovely.

In short, this troupe of dancers illustrates a wide variety of statistical concepts using naught but movement.

Now I just can't wait until they get to p-values and Bayes' theorem.
