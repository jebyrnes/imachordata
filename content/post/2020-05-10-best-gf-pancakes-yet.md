I love pancakes. My wife loves pancakes. My daughter LOVES chocolate pancakes (and takes a picture with her face smeared in chocolate every time she she finishes eating chocolate chip pancakes). But... my daughter has celiac. 

So, I've been working through a lot of GF pancake recipies, or using GF flour ([Cup 4 Cup](https://www.cup4cup.com/) is hands down THE BEST) with regular recipes to make them. I kept being unsatisfied, but, eventually learned a basic formula to them. To thick, to thin, too cakey, to fluffy (yes, this is a thing). This morning, I made a few adjustments, and I think hit on the right one, so I'm going to archive it here so I don't forget.

Also, if you are unsure of how to cook pancakges, find the [Good Eats Pancakge Episode](https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/good-eats/videos/flap-jack-do-it-again) where Alton really teaches you how to do it right.

*Best GF Pancakes Yet*

**Ingredients:**

- 1 Cup Gluten Free Flour Blend (I prefer Cup 4 Cup, but others likely work)
If no Xanthum gum in mix, add ~ 1/4 tsp  

- 1/3 Cup Oat Flour (this was a huge innovation!)  

- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder  

- 1/4 tsp baking soda  

- 1/2 tsp kosher salt  

- 2 Tbs sugar  

- 2 eggs  

- 1 1/2 - 2 C milk (to get it to the thinness of your liking - play with it)  

- 3 Tbs melted butter  


*Instructions:*

1. Whisk dry ingredients.  

2. Whisk wet ingedients.  

3. Mix wet into dry until all dry is incorporated. Lumpy batter is just fine.  

4. Heat griddle/cast iron/carbon steel pan to ~350F   

5. Spoon on 1/4-1/3 Cup batter. Cook until bubbles form around edges.  

6. Flip.  

7. Cook until just cooked through.
