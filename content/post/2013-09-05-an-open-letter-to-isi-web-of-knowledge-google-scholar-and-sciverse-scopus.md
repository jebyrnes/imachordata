_A bit of context first. This letter arose as a result of discussions regarding citations practices in meta-analyses on Twitter several weeks ago. We all agreed citations of work within meta-analyses should be counted, but noted that many modern citation counting services disregard any citations not in the main body of a paper. Appendix citations are dropped, however. And due to a variety of restrictions, we often only cite the papers we use as data in appendices, and so are not counted. Our discussion resulted in the following letter that sixty-eight scientists around the globe have signed. I look forward to further fruitful discussion with the organizations above (who have been contacted) and hope that this situation is corrected.

Update 1: Within a few minutes, Chris from Web of Knowledge contacted me to make sure he had the details correct, and has forwarded this to the WoK Dev team. We'll see if they get in contact.

Update 2: More signatures added on Nov 24, 2013. We're now at 72.

Update 3: Despite also hearing from SCOPUS that this was being forwarded on to their product manager, no word back. Also, no word from GS, despite this being sent directly to members of their dev team by common contacts.

Dear Staff & Support Teams,

We are writing as a community of researchers in ecology, evolution and conservation biology who rely on the citation metrics you provide.  We love your service, and, frankly, depend on it for a wide variety of reasons (e.g., identifying research trends, finding relevant papers, evaluating the influence of papers/researchers). However, in one respect your counts are becoming increasingly inaccurate.  We have come to realize that citations - sometimes hundreds of them - that we have made in the appendices of our own published papers are not being counted by your service. We felt obligated to bring this issue to your attention, as it affects the accuracy and reliability of your statistics.

We are a group of researchers who conduct meta-analyses: analyses of published data, typically gathered by extracting data from published scientific papers. The standard practice in our and many other fields is to include citations to works that we use for data - but in the case of meta-analyses in particular, these citations do not necessarily appear in the main reference section of our papers.  As meta-analyses regularly get their data from 50+ papers, and journals often have strict space limits and limits on the number of references, the citations are often included in supplementary material, most of which are online only (SOMs).  These appendices are subject to the same level of peer review as the core article.

As far as we understand, citations in SOMs are not recorded by you. Hence, the papers we cite do not receive the proper citation credit, and the citation lists you provide for our own papers are incomplete. The failure to consider references in SOMs  - particularly in the case of meta-analyses - severely reduces the accuracy of the citation counts you present for each paper. It is also poses a huge ethical problem for us because it means that we do not give proper credit, in the form of a citation, to the many superb scientists whose high-quality work is the jumping-off point for our own analyses. In turn, these colleagues of ours may be less inclined to be charitable when we come asking for data contributions to future meta-analyses.

**We ask that you consider including citations garnered from supplementary online  materials in academic journals.**

If there is any way that we can facilitate this by contacting journals and editors in our own fields, we are more than happy to help. We feel very strongly about correcting this problem, and hope it can lead to some tangible benefits for both you and countless numbers of scientists.

Thank you, and we look forward to engaging in a productive dialogue about this issue.

Signed,
