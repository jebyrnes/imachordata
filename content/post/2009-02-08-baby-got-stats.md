I was completely tickled last year with the oh so amusing [Statz Rappers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS9GmU5hr5w).  It kept me and my nerdy stats friends laughing for days.  Rapping.  Stats.  The Internet.

Good times.

But little did I know that rapping about statistics was really just hitting its stride on youtube.  [This is Why We Plot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7vHwYGSK1U) began my trip down the rabbit hole.  Quite a nice effort.  I followed this with that [Stats Rap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcuAh7Nafrc) - not bad, and oh so mellow.  Also I love the equations.

But the _pièce de résistance_ is Baby Got Stats from Dorry Serev in the biostats department  at JHU.  Oh. Dear. Lord.  I laughed.  I wept. I even put some of the [lyrics](http://www.dorryandsommer.com/baby_got_stats.html) into my .sig file.  Enjoy.

(note, mildly nsfw?  maybe?)

There are a ton more - just follow the related links.  It's kind of amazing.  And if anyone gets a yen to start doing some multivariate SEM or Bayesian raps, I want to know!
