There have been a steady stream of articles [over](http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090519/full/459305a.html) [the](http://gaggio.blogspirit.com/archive/2010/10/04/crowdfunding-science-utopia-or-reality.html) [years](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/science/12crowd.html) stating that now is the time for Science to embrace [Crowdfunding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_funding).  It is the wave of the future, they state.  It will link people to science directly.  Abandon the shackles of the NSF and NIH, ye meek and mild mannered scientists.  The internet is your salvation.

And along with this hoopla comes a small handfull of science crowdfunding sites, but few success stories.  There has been no large-scale well-advertised attempt at seeing whether crowdfunding really is a viable model for science.

Well, it's time we change that.

Announcing the [SciFund Challenge!](http://scifund.wordpress.com/)

My co-conspirator, Jai Ranganathan of [Curiouser and Curiouser](http://www.miller-mccune.com/category/curiouser/), and I have decided to spearhead a large effort to recruit scientists to try and crowd-fund a piece of their science.  We want to see, just how is crowdfunding for science different from normal funding?  Can we harness the power of our social networks, the online science blogosphere, and maybe the larger public to fund science?

Honestly, we have no idea.  But it's worth trying, and, hopefully, we can do some interesting post-mortem analyses once the project wraps up.  So go check out [our project blog](http://scifund.wordpress.com) including [a call to arms](http://scifund.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/the-scifund-challenge-a-call-to-virtual-arms/), [how this will work](http://scifund.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/how-will-the-scifund-challenge-work/), and our [sign-up form](http://scifund.wordpress.com/sign-up/).
