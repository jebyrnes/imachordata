I've been pretty stoked about the [This is What a Scientist Looks Like](http://lookslikescience.tumblr.com/) project on tumblr. So much so that I felt compelled to submit an (old) photo of [me doing field work](http://lookslikescience.tumblr.com/post/19591500659/jarrett-byrnes-marine-biologist-then-again). I mean, when one things science, they often think labcoats and microscopes. When one thinks ecology, they often think hiking in a forest or working out on a sunny grassland. (note: these are impressions I've gotten to people when I say these words - not what I think myself, natch.)

So, why not throw in something of what a marine ecologist at work looks like. So here's my shot:

Yeah, I admit, it's kind of a marine ecology beefcake shot, and definitely falls into the _Â¿Quien es el mas macho?_ school of marine ecology, but I kinda love it (and thanks to [Kristin Hultgren](http://eol.org/info/hultgren_fellow) for taking it on our wacky marine ecology roadtrip).

But I was not prepared for what was to happen next. Namely, [a good friend of mine](http://www.kirstenmunson.com/portfolio/) getting hold of it and showing the picture for what it really is - me making my James Bond escape after blowing up the Evil Villan's lair.

This is totally going to be the photo on the door of my lab one day.
