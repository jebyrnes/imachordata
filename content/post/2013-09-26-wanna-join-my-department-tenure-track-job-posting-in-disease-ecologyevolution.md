So, rolling into year two here in the [Biology Department at UMass Boston](http://www.umb.edu/academics/csm/biology), I have to say I'm having a delightful time.  Fabulous [colleagues](http://www.umb.edu/academics/csm/biology/faculty) (who I'm already co-authoring papers with - that's just how we roll), a easy access to multiple field sites and stations, a deliciously nerdy intellectual scene throughout Boston, a brand-spankin'-new [School for the Environment](http://www.umb.edu/academics/environment), and a nice waterfront setting.

![Yep, this is us!](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/umassbostonphoto-1024x682.jpg)

<p class="caption">Yep, this is us!</p>

So, I'm pleased to announce that we're hiring a disease ecologist/evolutionary biologist type in our department. And by disease, we're talking broadly - microbes, viruses, parasites, you name it!  Into chytrid fungus? Awesome. Coral disease? Cool. Evolution of echinoderm wasting diseases and their interaction with ocean warming? Bueno. Crazy theoretical modeling of multi-host disease dynamics in wild arboreal cow and wolverine communities? Fantastico! (also, where can I find these wild arboreal cows?)

The Biology Department at the University of Massachusetts, Boston seeks applicants for a full-time tenure track Assistant Professor in the Ecology/Evolution of Diseases in natural or domesticated populations starting in September 1, 2014. Successful applicants will be well versed in evolutionary and ecological theory of host-pathogen relationships, and engaged in research on the ecological circumstances and evolutionary processes associated with epidemics and their impacts on natural populations. Applications will be particularly welcome from candidates who are working on some aspect of global change, biodiversity, or evolutionary genomics and who utilize creative experimental approaches that investigate how host-pathogen interactions affect the structure, dynamics and function of communities and ecosystems (marine, terrestrial or aquatic). The successful applicant is expected to establish an externally funded research program, direct the research of students at the undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels, and interact with a dynamic group of ecologists and environmental biologists.

Excellence in teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels is expected. A Ph.D. and postdoctoral training (or equivalent professional experience) in population genetics, ecology or evolution is required.

The University has a strong faculty with substantial research and doctoral programs in Environmental Biology; Molecular, Cellular and Organismal Biology; and Environmental Sciences. Excellent opportunities exist to collaborate and engage in multidisciplinary research on campus, across the five UMass campuses and at UMass Boston's Nantucket Field Station.

Application materials must be submitted online. Please include a statement of teaching and research interests and goals, curriculum vitae, and 3-5 representative reprints. Applicants should also arrange for three letters of reference to be sent to Ecology/ Evolution Pathogens Search, Biology Department, University of Massachusetts, 100 Morrissey Blvd., Boston, MA 02125.

For further information, visit the Biology Department website at <http://www.umb.edu/academics/csm/biology>, or contact Ron Etter, Chair of Search Committee, at [ron.etter@umb.edu](mailto:ron.etter@umb.edu) or (617)-287-6613. Review of applications will begin on November 15, 2013 and will continue until the position is filled.
