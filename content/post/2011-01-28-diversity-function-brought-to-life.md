Last October, [Colin Bates and Jeff Morales](http://www.sciencefilm.org/) conducted a workshop on Scientific Filmmaking at my old stomping grounds, the [Bodega Marine Lab](http://bml.ucdavis.edu).  The two run [an awesome organization](http://www.sciencefilm.org/) whose sole mission is to train people in ways to tell compelling science stories via video.  As someone who has [worked on a scientific documentary before](http://reach.ucdavis.edu/programs/pike/index.shtml), film is an incredible medium to have science make a direct connection with the public.  So hats off to them.

But even cooler, one of my former labmates was the topic of one of the videos from the workshop!  So check out this awesome video about [Kris Aquilino](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/stachowicz/aquilino.shtml) below.  She gives a great introduction in to the wild world of science that asks whether the diversity of life on earth matters for how the world functions.
