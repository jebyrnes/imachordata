![](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/byrnes_tree.png)Science is a giant family.  Each Professor gives "birth" to a litter of PhD students over time, many of whom go on to have their own students, who have their own students, and so on and so forth ad infinitum.

While all of us know our academic parent (right?), at least some of our sciblings (depending on the age of the lab), and usually our academic grandparent, what about our great-grandparent?  Or great-great-grandparent.  Can my aacadmic lineage be traced back to Darwin?  Or Linneaus?  Indeed, something like 40% of mathematicians can indeed [trace themselves](http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/) back to [Leibniz](http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=60985).

Not it's time for Marine Ecologists to do the same.

[Mary O'Connor](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~oconnor/mary_web_page/Home.html) has graciously setup a [Marine Ecology Family Tree](http://academictree.org/mareco/) over at the wonderful [academictree.org](http://academictree.org/).  The site endeavours to see how all academic geneologies end up connecting.  Is your discipline not there?  Contact the admins.  But if you're a marine ecologist, [go there now](http://academictree.org/mareco/), login, and fill in your info!  Let's see how many degrees we're separated by!

(also, as more info is filled in, I'll update my tree on the right)
