_Today at [The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](http://nceas.ucsb.edu) we're having an open discussion about the future of scholarly publishing.  I may post some notes from it later, but, [Stephanie Pau](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~pau/StephanieSite/Home.html) and I have compiled a list of thought questions and helpful links to help folk prep.  And, as it was an interesting gathering of linkage, I thought it mide be useful more broadly.  So, below is the text of my email and the useful links.  I realize that I am blogging my email.  Is this a new low?  Perhaps.  Enjoy!_

Hello, all!  For today's open house, we'll be talking about the growing hubub regarding academic publishing and the relationship between scientists and publishers.  _Is it time for a change?  What is the way forward?_

This is a big topic, and not all of you may be aware of the things that have gone down over the past few months that are bringing this to a head.  As such, Steph and I have put together a list of links that give you an introduction to all of this as well as some questions to bear in mind while perusing them.  Don't worry, they're all pretty quick reads - short blog posts or an [Xtranormal video which is brilliant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMIY_4t-DR0).

Also exciting, we're going to have a few guests who are involved in scholarly publishing from campus (and maybe beyond).

[Marty Einhorn](http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/directors_council_members/martin-einhorn) (KITP) for perspective on http://arxiv.org and the physics community's take on this
[Josh Schimel](http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/labs/schimel/) (EEMB) who is on the ESA publications committee
[Chuck Bazerman](http://cits.ucsb.edu/users/chuck-bazerman) (Education) a consultant for <http://hypothes.is/>

See you at 4pm in the lounge.  And, as the weather has been gorgeous, if we want to continue the conversation after 5, Tony Ray's?

**Open House â€“ Is it time for a change in scientific publishing?**

_Questions to Ponder_

1.       Do we need a change our model of scientific publishing?  Why?

2.       What needs to change?

3.       Are scientists/ecologists ready for a change?  Are we too conservative or slow to adopt change in general, open access in particular?  I.e., good in theory, doesn't work in practice?  (<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/science/open-science-challenges-journal-tradition-with-web-collaboration.html?ref=science>)

4.       What are the differences between commercial (e.g., Elsevier) and non-profit journals (e.g., ESA) that affect the exchange of scientific information (<http://bjoern.brembs.net/comment-n820.html>)?  There does not appear to be a difference in quality as measured by the number of citations (<http://octavia.zoology.washington.edu/publishing/ecology_citationprice.html>)

5.       Do commercial journals offer us something that non-profit journals do not?  Prestige?  What about differences between ESA and PloS (high costs put on author) models?

6.       If the exchange of information is better served by open access, should we refuse to review for commercial journals?

7.       Is there a difference between exchange of information for the sake of the discipline and personal academic success?

Do publishers add value?  Nature says yes.
