As part of the [OpenPub](http://openpub.org) project, we're soliciting folk to send us videos about their experience with the scholarly publication process.  We want to use these to try and crowdfund the development of OpenPub - our preprint server with robust tools for discussion and interaction.  Interested? Check out the full request over [here](http://openpub.nceas.ucsb.edu/2013/02/25/give-us-your-thoughts-on-scholarly-publishing-in-eeb/) and/or email me!
