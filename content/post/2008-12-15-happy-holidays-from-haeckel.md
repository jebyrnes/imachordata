For those who need just the right holiday card for that certain someone, The Rhinobird has an [excellent collection of holiday cards](http://www.cafepress.com/therhinobird/6297751) using the images of [Ernst Haeckel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Haeckel) for purchase at cafepress!  Who knew a jellyfish could be so festive!

Sadly, no _Aurelia_ dreidels.  Or ascidians. (hrmph!) Maybe next time.
