For those who aren't following it, the [SEAPLEX](http://seaplexscience.com/) cruise blog is pretty amazing.  SEAPLEX is a cruise being led by none other than Miriam Goldstein of [The Oyster's Garter](http://seaplexscience.com/) to explore the Great North Pacific Trash Gyre.

OK, so, a gyre of trash may not be that great, but, you know, it's Great.  As in Awesome.  By which I mean Awe-inspiring kinda Great.  Not great.  You know.  Sheesh.

The cruise is not only ambitious in its goals to map out the garbage patch itself (and to see, is it a big patch, a bunch of islands, or what), but it's both [blogging](http://seaplexscience.com/) and [tweeting](http://twitter.com/seaplexscience) away giving the public a fascinating snapshot into real oceanographic and ecological science in real time.  And, they're being pretty candid, as can be seen below.

So keep your RSS-feeds updated, check your twitter feeds, and let's see just what Miriam and her hearty crew find out!
