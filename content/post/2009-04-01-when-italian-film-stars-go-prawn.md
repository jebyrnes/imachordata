After enlightening us last year to the strange proclivities of all manner of garden invertebrates, she's [back,](http://www.sundancechannel.com/greenporno/) filling us in on how animals, like [Crepidula fornicata](http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid18011345001?bclid=17841335001&bctid=18011212001) get down in the ocean.

Now I've heard it all before, but there's something about these bizarre little trinkets that is both beautiful, and could really wake up an invert zoo class full of sleepy students.  It even has [the obligatory barnacle video](http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid18011345001?bclid=17841335001&bctid=18011211001).

It's like David Lynch, Julie Taymor, and my copy of [Brusca & Brusca](http://www.amazon.com/Invertebrates-Richard-C-Brusca/dp/0878930973/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_c) had a baby.

Enjoy!  Oh, and, if you're not a biologist, it's more than a tad not safe for work.
