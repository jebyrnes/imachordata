So, someone over at [researchblogging.org](http://www.researchblogging.org) was decidedly foolish, and asked me to be one of their new editors-at-large for Biology.  That means, every Thursday, I'll be posting the three biology (typically ecology and evolution) research paper reviews linked through researchblogging.org that I enjoyed the most.  [My first post is up](http://researchblogging.org/news/?p=207), and hopefully there will be many more to come!
