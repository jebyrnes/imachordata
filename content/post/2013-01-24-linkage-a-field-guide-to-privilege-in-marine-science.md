As someone who, admittedly, benefitted a great deal from Privilege growing up (it definitely lowered the barriers to my becoming a succesful marine scientist), know that this is true of MANY Ecology and Evolutionary Biology folk, and now think a good deal about how I can lower those barriers for students and mentees that come under my aegis, you should all go over and check out Miriam Goldstein's [A field guide to privilege in marine science: some reasons why we lack diversity](http://deepseanews.com/2013/01/a-field-guide-to-privilege-in-marine-science-some-reasons-why-we-lack-diversity/).
