For the past three years, the [Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America](http://www.esajournals.org/loi/ebul) has hosted a wonderful entitled "Ecology on the Web".  Under the curation of Jeff Hollister, EoW started out and grew to provide a [number of links](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9623-91.2.232) to fantastic ecological projects on the web.

If you're reading this, you know that using the internet as a medium to facilitate communication between scientists is a passion of mine.  So I was delighted when Jeff asked me to take over the feature.

So for the next issue of the Bulletin, I'm hoping to take _Ecology on the Web_ and run with it a little bit,  In addition to featuring the web presence and products of great ecological projects, I'd also like to feature notable places where Ecologists are using the medium of the web to communicate, converse, argue, and generally share their science.  To that end, I'd like to also feature two blogs, and two exemplary blog posts or other form of online writing per issue.

So, please, feel free to submit now or for future issues.  Simple [provide me](mailto:byrnes@nceas.ucsb.edu) with a link and a brief (150 words or less) annotation about the link.

If you have found something on the web that is particularly compelling, interesting, or worthy of mention, I'd love to [hear about that](mailto:byrnes@nceas.ucsb.edu), too!

Lastly, if any of you have any great suggestions for interesting things that could be done with the feature, please leave them in the comments below.  I'd love some feedback!
