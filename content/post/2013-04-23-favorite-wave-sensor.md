So, Internet, I'm setting up a number of monitoring sites this summer.  I'm hoping to get good wave height measurements from them to look at disturbance.  I have yet to find something like the [CDIP](http://cdip.ucsd.edu/) swell height model for the Gulf of Maine (although, I'd love to hear that this is due to a failure of my google-fu).  So, I'm casting about for some good wave height sensors.

The problem I face is that I'd like to deploy a lot of them, and in some highly variable conditions, secured to subtidal transects.  Possibly for 6 months.  Or maybe even up to a year.  So, I'm trying to see if a lower cost smaller profile solution is available.  Something like a [tidbit](http://www.onsetcomp.com/products/data-loggers/tbi32-2050) for wave heights.

I've found a few that kinda sorta fit the bill, although not quite. There's the venerable [SeaBird](http://www.seabird.com/products/spec_sheets/26plusdata.htm), [products from RBR](http://www.rbr-global.com/products/tide-and-wave-instruments/submersible-wave-recorder-rbrduo-td-wave), the [SEAGUARD tide and wave recorder](http://www.aadi.no/Aanderaa/Products/Seaguard/WTR/default.aspx), and the [MIDAS](http://www.valeport.co.uk/products/waverecorders.aspx) from Valeport.

I'm a little worried that this might be too large or expensive given the conditions I'm deploying in.  Or I might be asking for a pipe dream.

Internet - any thoughts, recommendations, or experiences you'd care to share? Am I being ridiculous?
