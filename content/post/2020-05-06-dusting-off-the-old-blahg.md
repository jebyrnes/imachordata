Welp. It's been a spell. Time to bring ye olde blahg back.  

As I moved talking about marine science more on to [Deep Sea News](http://deepseanews.com), I realized that there's a huge part of my identity as a scientist that didn't work there.

Data nerdery.

As many of those posts were written in RMarkdown, I took the plunge and have remade this into a [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) site. It's my first venture here. I'm just glad I managed to port all of my old posts over!

There's definitely some things still to do - a comments section, etc - but, in the meantime, if you find some dust around the edges or a poor transition, now you can [file an issue on this blog's github repo!](https://github.com/jebyrnes/imachordata) HA!

But, we shall see how rebooting this goes. I've got a few things to write about.
