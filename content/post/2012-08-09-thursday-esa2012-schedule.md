ALl right - here's my Thursday schedule (mostly for myself so I can keep track of it on my phone).  I think in the morning, I just might park myself in the session on climate change & communities as one of my main interests for this meeting is...climate change and communities.  Also, I'm guessing I'll fill in the lower right hand side of [my bingo card](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/esa-2012-bingo/) (although I already got Bingo today on the lower line...)

If you can hang about for lunch, be sure to check out the following awesome workshop from 11:30-1:15
**WK 47 - How to Access Ecological and Evolutionary Datasets in R**
F150, Oregon Convention Center Organized by: K Ram, SA Chamberlain, C Boettiger
In the workshop we will showcase a live demonstration of several of our R packages and also lead a discussion on how you can develop similar tools for other data sources. We encourage you to bring a laptop so you can participate along (wifi permitting).
Speakers: C Boettiger, UC Davis SA Chamberlain, Rice University K Ram, University of California Berkeley

For the afternoon, there are a lot more that is great.  Of course.  One option might be to plant oneself at

**SYMP 19 - The National Climate Assessment: Preliminary Findings, Building Assessment Capacity, and Implementing a Sustained Assessment Process**
Portland Blrm 251, Oregon Convention Center Organized by: ET Cloyd (ecloyd@usgcrp.gov), N Grimm Endorsed by: Biogeosciences, Policy
Moderator: ET Cloyd
This session will present key findings from the draft 2013 National Climate Assessment report; discuss implementing a sustained assessment process, including developing indicators of climate change and impacts; and provide an opportunity to comment on the draft NCA report and ongoing assessment process.

But, individual talks might again be in my future.  In particular, I want to check out
