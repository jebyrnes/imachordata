It's my most favorite time of year!  Time for the science music video extravaganza known as the [Annual Chemical Ecology Filmfest!](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL201Hbh_nPHeOPp9ZY_X12pXE3Hdiwf4T)  It's the fourth one!  Congrats to Jeremy Long and all of his students for keeping this source of awesomeness going.  Sit back, and take a look at a few here, or go over and watch the whole thing.
