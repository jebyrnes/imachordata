Well, [my mind has been blown.](http://www.ncseagrant.org/home/coastwatch?task=showArticle&view=listarticles&id=623) Fisheries analysis based on tweets?!  How cool!  In the age of [LTER](http://www.lternet.edu/) (n.b. I work for the sbc lter), the comingn of [NEON](http://www.neoninc.org/), etc., it's nice to see an innovative of getting large quantities of data from outside of the academic box.

And I can think of a myriad of field science/[twitter](http://twitter.com/home) uses:

* oceanography: get boaters to tweet for a temperature reading with a lat/long and ocean color

* rare species ecology: have hikers tweet every time they go on a trail, and tweet again if they see something rare

* subtidal ecology: have divers tweet when/where they go, and some qualitative measure of diversity or abundance of target speciesAnd, really, this could probably be subsidized by 10 cents per tweet or something to get buy-in.  Algorithmically, catching cheaters shouldn't be too hard (outlier analysis, etc).

Sounds like an interesting [NCEAS](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) kind of idea....
