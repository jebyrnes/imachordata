I woke up this morning to a wonderful email in my inbox (thanks, [Fergus!](http://oolong.co.uk/)) letting me know about a little musical delight.  A song about diurnal zooplankton migration entitled, well, [Diurnal Migration](http://hannahwerdmuller.com/track/diurnal-migration).  With lyrics like _Much of the ocean is not yet explored/ Though submarines pootle about the sea floor_, how can you go wrong? (Also, I now have an image of [Dr. M.](http://deepseanews.com/author/dr-m/) pootling about the seafloor).

So, I went on and decided to listen to the rest of the album, [Pre-Apocalyptic Love Song](http://hannahwerdmuller.com/album/pre-apocalyptic-love-song), by [Hannah Werdmuller](http://twitter.com/#!/pathdigger), an ecologist-singer-songwriter.  With songs about Grow-Bags, being prepared for the apocalypse (_I showed you my heart, you showed me your homemade snare trap _), how could you go wrong?  So go [check it out!](http://hannahwerdmuller.com/album/pre-apocalyptic-love-song)

And then things got even more awesome.

I noticed she had a musical [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/#!/Hanjabanja) where she linked to a new collection of songs, [Geek Like Me](http://geekpop.bandcamp.com/album/geek-like-me) from the virtual music festival [Geek Pop](http://geekpop.podbean.com/blog/).  Basically, it had me at its first song, animals, with the phrase _Let's make love like salmon living in fresh water/ You leave it in the bath I'll come and pick it up later_ and the fact that it had a song entitled [Brokeback Workbench](http://geekpop.bandcamp.com/track/brokeback-workbench-2).

Definitely the second triumph of the morning.  And the [website](http://geekpop.podbean.com/hello/) has more free tracks [scattered about](http://geekpop.podbean.com/2011/03/11/geek-pop-2011-festival-highlights/).

Yay!  Just what I needed to make my morning of recoding some ill behaving R packages worth it!
