From this issue of the [Ascidian News](http://depts.washington.edu/ascidian/AN66.html) comes word of something....well....awesome.

Tunicate Whiskey.

To wit, hollow out one _Halocynthia roretzi_.  Fill tunic with [Soju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju) (korean whiskey).  Drink.

For some reason, I think this would work really well with [Laphroaig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laphroaig) or other Islay malts.  Or, perhaps, give that nice Islay character to something more generic - spice up your Johnny walker with a little _Styela_.

On second thought, a big _Styela_ is about the size of a shot glass...
