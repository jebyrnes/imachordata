Whew, it's been a bit since I posted here.  Rest assured, little sea squirts, there are some interesting new things in the works.  Some things that are science-y (in which I try and use this blog as a sounding board/ lab notebook) and some things not so much.

In the not so much category, a ton of my time has lately been going to the organizing of the [#SciFund challenge](http://scifund.wordpress.org) - a large initiative to try and crowdfunding for science!  If you haven't been following it, check out our initial manifesto [here](http://scifund.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/the-scifund-challenge-a-call-to-virtual-arms/).

I'm pretty stoked about the whole thing - it's a real way of connecting science to the public via a funding mechanism.  And with us launching on November 1st, it's been an absolute pleasure to watch the creative and innovative videos that participating scientists have been putting together to solicit funds.

Videos, you say?  Am I doing one?

Why yes!  So to give you a hint of what's to come, here's a brief preview of my #SciFund video.  I think you'll all agree, it's vintage me, attempting to sell one of the more arcane (to the public) pieces of my research in a way that might just connect.  We shall see.

 More to come in a week...
