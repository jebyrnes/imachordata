![](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/lterleft.jpg)It seems that blogs, twitter, etc, are beginning to really leak into the consciousness of ecologists!  In two weeks, I'm attending the [LTER All Scientists Meeting (ASM)](http://asm.lternet.edu/).  As I browsed through the working grounp lists, I came across the following: [Blogs, Posts, and Tweets: Potential Uses of Web-Based and Social Networking Media for Communicating LTER Science and Conducting Citizen Science](http://asm.lternet.edu/2009/workgroups/blogs-posts-and-tweets-potential-uses-web-based-and-social-networking-media-communic).

Tres cool.

[The LTER network](http://www.lternet.edu/), for those unfamiliar, is perhaps the oldest network of Long Term Ecological Research projects, well, anywhere.  It consists of a collection of sites, each representing a different ecosystem type - from [kelp forests](http://sbc.lternet.edu/) to the [arctic tundra](http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/) to even [urban ecosystems](http://www.beslter.org/) (oddly in my hometown).  The data from these sites is largely out there and publicly available, and the network funds some really top-notch projects from [established researchers](http://www.cbs.umn.edu/eeb/faculty/TilmanDavid/) and up-and-coming [postdocs](http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/labs/cardinale/people/byrnes/index.html).

Whoops, how did that link get in there!

Because it is a network of sites sharing data and tools, there is a ton of cyberinfrastrcuture.  Given the types of folk that has recruited into the project, I'm not surprised that the network is hip to blogs, twitter, and the like.  And I'm pretty psyched that we're having a working group on how to harness their power.  Should be neat.
