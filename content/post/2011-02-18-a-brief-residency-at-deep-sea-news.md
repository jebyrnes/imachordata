Hey, all!  For the rest of the month, I'm the Scientist in Residence over at [The Deep Sea News](http://www.deepseanews.com)!  Muchas gracias to Rick, Miriam, Kevin, and the rest of the crew for bringing me on board.  My first [post is up](http://deepseanews.com/2011/02/scientist-in-residence-jarrett-brynes/) where I discuss some of my work on How are extinctions and invasions shaping food webs?

Also, contrary to what Rick may have you believe, I'm at [NCEAS](http://www.nceas.org), not [NESCent](http://www.nescent.org/).  hehe.

More posts to come!
