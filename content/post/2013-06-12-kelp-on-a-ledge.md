Day 2 of dives with Sarah out at SML.  Today we hit two sites that were quite different - both from each other and from Norwegian Cove the other day.  The Ledges are in the channel between Appledore and Smuttynose, so, they get good flow running through.  This was key, as it blew sediments from the previous day's storm out fairly quickly.  And viz was really quite nice.  While it used to be a barren (at least on one side) 10 years ago, it appears that it's now a mix of kelps and _Desmarestia_ with some _Chondrus_, filamentous reds, and others thrown in for good measure.

Indeed, some parts were super kelpy, although, not dominated by large adults.  The mix of sizes was fairly astounding, even where thing were at high densities.

Note all of the holes you see, though.  The site was also packed with little snails like _Lacuna vincta_ that appeared to be doing quite a job on the kelps.

What will this mean for later in the summer?  Particularly with _Heterosiphonia_ around in patches.

All in all, a nice site to sample.  More soon on Smith's Cove.  Which was...
