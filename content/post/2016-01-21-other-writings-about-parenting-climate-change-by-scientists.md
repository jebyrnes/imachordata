OK, so, I spoke too soon. There are at least a few stabs by scientists writing about being a parent who studies climate/environmental change. As folk send me more, I'll try and keep this list updated. While there's some great stuff here, I feel like this is an empty niche for some great writing. Maybe you want to contribute, too?  Towards that end, anyone who has a yen, I will be happy to post, repost, or link your own writings here under my [science parent](http://www.imachordata.com/category/science-parent/) category.

OK, the list:
