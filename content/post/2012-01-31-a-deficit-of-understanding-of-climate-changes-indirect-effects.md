We know that warming, storms, drought, acidification, and the myriad of other effects of climate change will impact natural ecosystems.  Most of our studies have concentrated on direct effects, though.  For example, if you change temperature, you alter herbivore grazing rates.  But what about indirect effects?  For example, I've found that increased intense storm frequency may remove kelp which will have an indirect effect on the structure of kelp forest food webs.

So, I did a little experiment.  I went to [Web of Knowledge](http://isiknowledge.com) and searched the following term: "climate change" AND "impact".  I got 21,310 entries.  Then I searched again using this query: "climate change" AND "impact" AND "indirect effect".

The search returned 35 entries.

Surely, this must be a mistake.  So instead of "indirect effect" I went with just "indirect".  506.  Better.  If I took out the word impact I went up to 1,202.  So, at maximum, 5.6%.

OK, maybe this was because I was looking at EVERYTHING.  So I filtered it down to just Environmental Sciences and Ecology.  "climate change" AND "impact": 9,248. "climate change" AND "impact" AND "indirect": 173.  Removing impact got me to 689.  Only 7.5%.

I'm guessing there are other careful ways of filtering, but, either way, I'm pretty surprised that even at this point, the study of the indirect of climate change still accounts for so little of our knowledge.  Pretty interesting.  Although I'm heartened by the fact that this literature seems to be increasing exponentially.
