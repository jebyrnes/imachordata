So, today, I'm going to catch a ferry out to the [Shoals Marine Lab](http://www.sml.cornell.edu/).  I'm just going to be out for a day to meet with the undergrad intern I'm mentoring.  I'll be back later this summer to work with her and setup some permanent monitoring transects.

I have to be honest, this is one of those moments in my life where I am watching a dream come through.  I went to SML in the summer of 1999 to take some classes.  It changed everything for me.  I cannot recount the number of paths that opened up due to that summer than I have run down, higgledy-piggledy.  To return now as a mentor and researcher?  To have the chance to really learn the secrets of the sea around the Isles of Shoals? To come back with new eyes after a decade of developing as a scientist? I'm having a hard time expressing my excitement and joy.

Rather than kvell any more about the place and my excitement, here's a video from the participants of the Underwater Research Course at SML (which, also, totally formative to who I am as a scientist - thanks, Jim!)  I think it conveys a lot of what I could say, but in images and video that's much more telling.
