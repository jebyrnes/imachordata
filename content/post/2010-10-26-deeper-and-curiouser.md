I've been totally stoked that Jai Ranganathan's science podcast [Voyage of the Beagle](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~ranganathan/podcast.html) has been rebooted as [Curiouser and Curiouser](http://www.miller-mccune.com/category/curiouser/) and that its first episode was on the science of [overfishing](http://www.miller-mccune.com/curiouser/curiouser-and-curiouser-fishing-overs-and-unders-24348/).  I contacted the folk over at DSN about it, and they kindly let me add a [guest post](http://deepseanews.com/2010/10/curiouser-and-curiouser/). Yay!  Check it out, and enjoy Jai's [podcasts](http://www.miller-mccune.com/category/curiouser/)!
