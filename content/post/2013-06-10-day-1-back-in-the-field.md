Well, today was it.  After a 2 year hiatus behind my computer screen, my skin now softer and more delicate from its soothing rays, I hopped back in the water FOR SCIENCE!  Not only that, but it was my return to dry suit diving.  Oh, dry suit diving.  I really didn't miss you and your weird buoyancy tricks (note to self, get ankle weights, as old ones have desintegrated).

It was a great day, despite feeling kinda like the first day back at school.  Ted (lab manager) and I came out to SML to work with a fantastic undergrad I'm advising for the summer, as well as do some site scouting of our own.  The weather report said that things would turn awful in the afternoon/early evening (and was right), so, a morning dive on the backside of Appledore was just the thing.

We were there to help Sarah census the invasive [_Heterosiphonia japonica_](http://seaweeds.uib.no/?art=769) to look at its distribution with respect to a depth and exposure gradient (see also this kick butt paper by [Christine Newton et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062261)).  And the backside of Appledore is _quite_ exposed.  The transects we were sampling are next to a spot in the intertidal that got wiped bare by this winter's storms.

What intrigued me about the transects was two things.  I remember this area being super-kelpy.  Indeed, the wave exposure limited _Codium_ back when that alga was the big bad (I've heard it's quite rare here, and in a quick checkout at The Cribs, I only saw 3 individuals).  But now...well, there are some kelps, but, mostly, it's red and brown filamentous algae.  A lot of _Desmerestia viridis_ to be sure, but a lot of red and brown puffiness.  That, and a lot more _Chondrus_.  I mean, we were fairly shallow, but, still.  Interesting.

Not a lot of _Heterosiphonia_, though.  It's going to be interesting to see how Sarah's project turns out.  Some sites have been heavy with it, some light.

I'm just glad to be back in, and seeing how the place has changed.  Steneck's [Flips & Locks](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2013/00000089/00000001/art00004) paper was an interesting update on how this system is doing. I'm going to be curious to browse around and try and take the big whole community perspective I honed at the SBC LTER and see what there is to see here.
