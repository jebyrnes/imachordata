I just saw this video from the Pawlik lab doing work done in the Aquarius habitat in the Caribbean.  I just adore it. There's something about the lighthearted sense of fund and enjoyment behind the soundtrack that syncs up with the work that's being done that captures some of the essence of what subtidal work can be (even for those of us in colder temperate climes).  Enjoy this research pastiche!
