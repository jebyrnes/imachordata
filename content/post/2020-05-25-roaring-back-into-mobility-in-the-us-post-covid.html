<p>As part of the <a href="/2020/05/07/the-covid19r-project/">Covid19R Project</a>, I’ve been working on a new package, <a href="https://github.com/Covid19R/covid19mobility">covid19mobility</a>. It started as an effort to pull in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility">Apple Mobility Trends</a>, and has since morphed as more mobility data comes out. Right now, I’m working through the <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">Google Mobility Data</a>, &amp; I’m interested in the <a href="https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19">Descartes mobility data</a> and any others you can suggest down below (link to source)! But the data itself - it’s FASCINATING!</p>
<p>As I finished getting the Apple data in (there are massive issues for all of the aforementioned data sets in terms of getting standardized location codes - I’m trying to use either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO 3166 2</a> standard for countries and states or the <a href="https://www.unece.org/cefact/locode/service/location">UN LOCODE</a> for cities, and many of the states and cities have different names than those in the data standards. Watch me <code>dplyr::mutate()</code> and <code>ifelse</code> my way into oblivion)..</p>
<p>OK, that was a long rant, let me start over -</p>
<p>As I finished getting the Apple data in, I decided to check it out with a quick vignette. It’s Memorial Day, US states are starting to open up - I wonder what our traffic looks like? Now, note, Apple’s data is the relative volume of directions requests for each data type. So, let’s look at the US…</p>
<pre class="r"><code># remotes::install_github(&quot;covid19r/covid19mobility&quot;)

<p>Wow. So, driving is basically back to where it was pre-lockdown. Walkign is coming back, but isn’t there yet. And transit is… nada. Looking at this using a GAM to smooth it all out shows the same thing (I know, I know, there’s much more complex and fun timeseries stuff to do here, but…)</p>

<p>The driving trend is really interesting. Is this really due to everywhere going up uniformly? To investigate, I pulled in the subregional data - for the US this just has driving stats. And then used the awesome <a href="https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/">geofacet</a> package from Ryan Hafen to visualize. I’ll just use GAMs in order to facilitate visualization without the wigglies due to within-week variation.</p>

<p>So, a few places have stayed - Hawaii, Mass, and a few others - and others have gone WAAAY up - ND, Wyoming, Montata. Looking at it another way - we can really see how the top 5 states drive the trend up - BUT - with some exceptions, driving is still back to normal most places</p>

<p>Surprised Florida is at the bottom, currently, but, really interesting to see how most states are mostly recovered in terms of driving. Now I want to run this after memorial day and see how it looks!</p>
