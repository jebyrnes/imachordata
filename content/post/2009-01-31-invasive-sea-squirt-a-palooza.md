![](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/iissc_2.jpg) Attention tunicate nerds!  The Proceedings of the 2nd International Invasive Sea Squirt Symposium (I love that name) (and, OK, it's Conference, not Symposium, but how could I resist renaming it to something more fun!) are now [online!](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2009/index1.html) And there's a lot there to check out.

First off, we now know the tunicate formerly known as _Didemnum sp. A, D. vestum, D. vexillum, D. lutarium, D. lahillei, D. helgolandicum_, and the ever popular D. whattheheckisthisium depending on which country it was found in is ALL THE SAME SPECIES!  To those of us who have been following the spread of _Didemnum_ all over the world, I have to admit, it's kind of like the angels sang.  Thanks to the persistence of [Gretchen Lambert](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2009/AI_2009_4_1_Lambert.pdf) and the crackerjack genetics work of [Lauren Stefaniak](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2009/AI_2009_4_1_Lambert.pdf) (who was my student back when I was an underwater research TA  *ahem*!) we've got this bad boy nailed.  And it may be from Japan!  Oh, I do so love it when a story comes together.

There are also loads of other interesting stories - the creeping spread of _Styela plicata_, the effects of _S. clava_ on aquaculture, tales of [ascidians hitchhiking on crabs and lobsters](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2009/AI_2009_4_1_Bernier_etal.pdf), [culturing guidelines for botryllids](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2009/AI_2009_4_1_Epelbaum_etal.pdf) including how sometimes they are EATEN FROM THE INSIDE BY CILLIATES!  It's fun for the whole ascidian nerd family.  By which I mean mine.  And my hypothetical future children.

But perhaps my favorite paper of the whole lot is a paper on the potential market for farming [Styela clava](http://www.aquaticinvasions.net/2009/AI_2009_4_1_Karney_Rhee.pdf)!  Yes!  Finally a citable reference for these little guys.  No recipes, true, but, it's a start.

Because, really, you don't need to go far to begin seeing them creep into our cuisine.  You can [even find them frozen](http://www.jayone.com/green/new_product.php#5) from a company called "Nature & People".  Heck, you can [buy them in markets in North Carolina](http://www.news-record.com/node/17936).  Truly, sea squirt haute cuisine is within our grasp!

![](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/blowfish_squirt_soup-300x225.jpg)And of course, online, _Styela_ is making its way into into food blogs.  There's the perrenial favorite [Mideodok-chim](http://english.triptokorea.com/english/viewtopic.php?t=4251) recipe, of course.  But now more dishes are making their way into the [blogs, too!](http://immaeatchu.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/dae-bok/) Blowfish and squirt!  Delish!  The soup looks really tasty, actually...

![](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sea_squirts_001-225x300.jpg)But why stay traditional!  [You could mix in some key lime, aji amarillo,](http://chadzilla.typepad.com/chadzilla/2008/02/sea-squirts.html)

[ and salt.](http://chadzilla.typepad.com/chadzilla/2008/02/sea-squirts.html) Is it wrong that it looks so tasty?  This blogger describes them as tasting like a fatty oyster.  This of course brings up the possibility of deep frying...

So, mysteries solved, new culinary height on the horizon - it's an exciting time for invasive squirts.  What else will the rise of slime bring us?
