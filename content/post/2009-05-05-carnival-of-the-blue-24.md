Carnival of the Blue #24 is [up over at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Sea Notes](http://montereybayaquarium.typepad.com/sea_notes/2009/05/carnival-of-the-blue-24.html) There are some great articles about [clams](http://ouroboros.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/remain-clam-bivalves-as-models-for-aging-research/), [corals](http://www.interney.net/blogs/malla/2009/04/28/malla_interview_coral_biologist_ginnie_c_1/), and more!  I've been a slacker on these, so it was great to participate and see how the carnival has grown into such a wide and varied range  of posts!
