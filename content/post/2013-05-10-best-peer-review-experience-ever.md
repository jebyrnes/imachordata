So, I recently submitted a piece regarding the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology.  Simultaneous to posting, I [put up a preprint in PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/11/) and also put it on [Google Docs for line by line commentary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ac0tX-i6zELc75ij8Voyg5Rj4AQYEtGvpAiYcGcql_I/edit?usp=sharing) (which you are welcome to give!).  I asked in both places that commenters identify themselves, unless they felt deeply uncomfortable.

OMG the experience has been amazing!

At PeerJ you can comment on the main page of the article, and others can rate it - which is fantastic - and I've gotten some wonderful feedback there (thanks Lars!)

The Google Doc experience has been even more fascinating, given the ability to put in line by line comments.

One of our reviewers is using the Google Doc for their comments.  It has made it easy to see what they are saying, respond to things that I think are relevant (or I'll just change some of the text in the next draft for bigger changes), and have an interactive experience with the reviewer.  It absolutely fabulous.

I've been really fascinated by the idea of how collaboration can improve peer review ever since reading Leek et al.'s 2011 piece [Cooperation between Referees and Authors Increases Peer Review Accuracy](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026895). I'm delighted that one of our reviewers has embraced that ethos, and in so doing, I can see how this will really help with future publications if not just [Ross Mounce](http://rossmounce.co.uk/), but everyone embraced this model.  Very cool!
