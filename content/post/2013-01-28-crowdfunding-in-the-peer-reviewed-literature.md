[![ResearchBlogging.org](http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png)](http://www.researchblogging.org)The final version of Wheat et al.'s paper [Raising money for scientific research through crowdfunding](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2012.11.001) is out in Trends in Ecology and Evolution.  A more hefty piece of #SciFund analysis is behind it (slowed down in no small part because of my sloooow processing of new data in fancy models).  The Wheat et al. paper is a lovely short piece that Rachel and Yiwei (who crowdfunded the excellent [Alaska Predator Research Expedition](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1132209804/the-lost-world-documenting-alaskas-ecological-fron?ref=card) that has it's new website over [here](http://www.ecologyalaska.com/)) were gracious enough to ask Jai and I to participate in.  In it, we cover the basics of crowdfunding for the academic sciences - what is it? what are the platforms you might use? what are some strategies for success?

Overall, this is a nice, gentle introduction that you should send to any colleague who either appears interested in crowdfunding, curious as to what it is, or is highly skeptical of the entire enterprise.

So go [check it out](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2012.11.001)!
