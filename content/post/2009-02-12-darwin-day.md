HAPPY BIRTHDAY DARWIN!  On the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Lord, Master, and all around Deity of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (right?), I can only offer up my humble prayers.  What better place than a strange shrine to Darwin in Puerto Ayora in the Galapagos.

(Yes, that is me.  You have no idea how happy it made some adorable little old ladies to be asked to take this photo.)
