For anyone interested in the latest and greatest in marine ecology right now, but who aren't able to get to San Diego for [the Western Society of Naturalists 2010 meeting](http://www.wsn-online.org), follow along as a bunch of of [liveblog and livetweet](http://www.mikenish.com/WSN2010/) talks from the meeting.  Very cool new stuff on the state of the oceans and marine science.
