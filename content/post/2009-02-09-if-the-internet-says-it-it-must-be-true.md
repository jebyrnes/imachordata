Oh!  Excitement!  My [dissertation has been posted online by Proquest](http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1609473491&sid=6&Fmt=2&clientId=1563&RQT=309&VName=PQD).  Clearly, according to the internet, I must actually be a Doctor.  Thanks, Internet!

Of course, looking at the page, the internet also thinks I am a Limnologist, but, well, we'll let that one slide.

(now if only those copies of the dissertation that I ordered months ago would show up...)
