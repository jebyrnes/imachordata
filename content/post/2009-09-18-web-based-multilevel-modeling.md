[This](http://yeroon.net/lme4/) is tremendously cool.  A nice intuitive web-based interface for the lme4 package in R (and you neither need to know R or understand the intricacies of the lme4 package) that gives you pdf output and plots.  If you just want to play around and not worry about coding things up, it's a great little option.  Be sure to check out the [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OHps7z3Pqc&hd=1).
