Happy Friday, everyone.  To celebrate the end of the week, I leave you with what is hands down my favorite [#SciFund](http://scifund.rockethub.com) video from round 2.  And I don't just say this because it was made by a collaborator of mine of the #SciFund paper that we happen to be editing right this very moment (or, in half an hour or so).  I say this because it is a beautiful example of the fusion of (silly) Art and Science.  That it is my favorite from a sea of awesome videos also says a lot about how my brain works, but more of that another time.

The project is called [Beach of the Goliath Crabs](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/7449-beach-of-the-goliath-crabs) by the ever amazing [Dr. Zen Faulkes](http://doctorzen.net).  The project itself is pretty awesome - looking at environmental and evolutionary drivers of gigantism in the teeny tiny _Lepidopa benedicti _.  It's a great project with a GREAT video channeling Godzilla and other classic Japanese monster movies.  Definitely worth [kicking in a few bucks](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/7449-beach-of-the-goliath-crabs/fuel/reward_selection) to make this research happen (and it won't even take very many of those bucks to hit Zen's goal!)

Awesome, yes?  Worth [funding](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/7449-beach-of-the-goliath-crabs/fuel/reward_selection) just for the video.  And you get hot Science to boot!

Also, that finger image makes a kickass [meme](http://memegenerator.net/Fighty-Crab).

So, what are you waiting for, go over and check out Zen's full [Beach of the Goliath Crab](http://www.rockethub.com/projects/7449-beach-of-the-goliath-crabs) proposal.  And if you feel inspired, [check out a few other projects to crowdfund](http://scifundchallenge.org) (or view 'em broken down into [categories](http://scifundchallenge.org/scifund-projects/)).  There's a lot of amazing science there, and some wonderful science communication videos.  Enjoy, and Happy Friday!
