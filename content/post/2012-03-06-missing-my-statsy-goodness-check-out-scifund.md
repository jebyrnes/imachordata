I know, I know, I have been kinda lame about posting here lately.  But that's because my posting muscle has been focused on the new analyses for what makes a succesful #SciFund proposal.  I've been posting them at the #SciFund blog under the [Analysis tag](http://scifund.wordpress.com/category/scifund-analysis/) - so check it out.  There's some fun stats, and you get to watch me be a social scientist for a minute.  Viva la interdisciplinarity!
