Allright, folk!  The final documents have been signed, sealed, and delivered.  Looks like I'll be starting a position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at UMass Boston in the fall.  That's right, soon the Byrnes Lab is going to become a reality.  Get ready, Science, because this is going to be an adventure!
