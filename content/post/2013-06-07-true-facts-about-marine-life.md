Because there hasn't been enough ocean silliness lately...

I've long been a fan of [Ze Frank](http://www.zefrank.com/).  But who knew that one of the next places he'd be turning his razor sharp with was on the natural world.  And not only that, but, he'd make sure everything is pretty much scientifically kosher.  So, I give you three things that nearly made me laugh so hard I was almost glad I wasn't in a drysuit (because tight neck seals and laughing = no fun?), in escalating order of hilarity.  Note, some of this is not so SFW in a mild manner, but certainly always SFDSN.
