Man, this afternoon is going to be interesting.  There are two sessions that I want to sit all the way through!  I'll be speaking in the Growing Pains in Ecology session, so I'll be there all afternoon, but, the NutNet session looks pretty amazing as well.

**OOS 33 - Growing Pains: Taking Ecology Into the 21st Century**
A106, Oregon Convention Center
Organized by: C Strasser (carly.strasser@ucop.edu), J Tewksbury, S Hampton
Moderator: C Strasser
A discussion of the most important steps for ecology to take to address the complex problems set before our field by society.
