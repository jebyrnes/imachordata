![](http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-19-at-4.56.12-PM.png) I've long been pretty stoked that _Methods in Ecology and Evolution_ [has a blog](http://methodsblog.wordpress.com/).   And now the upstart crew over at _Oikos_ is [getting into the online game](http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/) with their delightful offering.  Go check it out!

**Update**: Believe it or not, I titled this post before the latest at [Jabberwocky](http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2011/05/05/new-mexico-is-in-the-hizz-ouse-blogrolling/).  Great minds, I say.
