After 45 days, with $76,230 raised from 1440 people, I am a pretty proud papa.

My own project hit 70% bringing in $4,600 for kelp forest research.  While not complete, it funds one full round of sampling trips and a little extra, so, I'm super excited!  And now the data from RocketHub and #SciFund participants begins to flow in.  Time to start doing some analyses on what worked, what didn't, and begin to lay out the future of crowdfunding in science!
