            <p>I&rsquo;ll admit it.  There&rsquo;s one thing that always makes me sad working on a mac.  R.  How does R make me sad on a mac?  I look over at my compatriots in Windows using fun Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like <a href="http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/">Tinn-R</a>, and I sigh.  On the other hand, I just had the sad little text editor and shell.  Sure, it was enough, and I had wrung some sweet sweet code from that simple setup, but windows would get lost, I&rsquo;d lose track of what file was where, what plot window was open, and would sometimes even forget which instance of R I was working in when I was working on two projects at the same time (one for simulation, one for analysis).</p>
<p>I mean, sure, I could go through the rigamarole of doing everything through some flavor of <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Emacs</a> like a 31337 h4X0r.  But my Emacs days are behind me.  I would have preferred a simpler solution.</p>
<p>So when I saw news of a new, cross-platform, free, lovely IDE called <a href="http://www.rstudio.org">RStudio</a> hit <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/tag/ide/">R-bloggers</a> and the Twitterverse, I rejoiced.</p>
<p>But would it be just a kludgy piece of bunk, or a nice, smooth, user experience?  I figured I&rsquo;d give it a whirl.  I hopped on over to <a href="http://www.rstudio.org">the website</a>, and had a pleasant easy download experience.  Then I fired it up, and ran an old analysis.  After fiddling around a little just to get my feet on the ground (which took only a minute or two - the whole thing was quite intuitive), I was pretty pleased.  The interface was clean, simple, and purty.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_618&rdquo; align=&quot;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&quot;614&rdquo; caption=&quot;Oh!  Quite the little interface, there!  Click to get a larger view.&quot;]<img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/rstudio-1024x748.png" alt="RStudio Window">[/caption]</p>
<p>And some features - such as image exporting - were like a dream.  So easy, in fact, that I decided to confront it with the problem of exporting an image for publication at the proper image quality (something which is always a bit of a hassle in R normally).  But to my delight, no problem.  Just fiddled with the size a little bit, and presto!  High quality pub-ready image.</p>
<p>So, overall, I&rsquo;m impressed.  And with a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rstudioapp">Twitter feed</a>, <a href="http://blog.rstudio.org/">blog</a>, and interactive <a href="http://support.rstudio.org/">support forum</a>, I think it looks like this IDE is going to be a great tool for science.  So go check it out!</p>
