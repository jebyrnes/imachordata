<p>In the not so much category, a ton of my time has lately been going to the organizing of the <a href="http://scifund.wordpress.org">#SciFund challenge</a> - a large initiative to try and crowdfunding for science!  If you haven&rsquo;t been following it, check out our initial manifesto <a href="http://scifund.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/the-scifund-challenge-a-call-to-virtual-arms/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty stoked about the whole thing - it&rsquo;s a real way of connecting science to the public via a funding mechanism.  And with us launching on November 1st, it&rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure to watch the creative and innovative videos that participating scientists have been putting together to solicit funds.</p>
<p>Videos, you say?  Am I doing one?</p>
<p>Why yes!  So to give you a hint of what&rsquo;s to come, here&rsquo;s a brief preview of my #SciFund video.  I think you&rsquo;ll all agree, it&rsquo;s vintage me, attempting to sell one of the more arcane (to the public) pieces of my research in a way that might just connect.  We shall see.</p>
<p>More to come in a week&hellip;</p>
