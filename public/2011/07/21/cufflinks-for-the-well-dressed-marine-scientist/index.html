            <p>So, I&rsquo;m-a-gettin&rsquo; hitched in, what, just less that 6 weeks to a singularly <a href="http://lilarose.org/">lovely lady</a>.  As I determine the proper <em>haute couture</em> for the nuptials, I&rsquo;ve begun to have fun with one piece in particular.  Cuffilnks.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to go Tux (and I do so love a good tuxedo), cufflinks are a must.  But what kind of cufflinks should a gentleman marine biologist wear?  Why, sea-creature themed, of course.  I began my search looking for ascidian themed cufflinks and studs. Sadly, no jeweler, even on etsy, has yet decided to imortalize the beauty of a <em>Ciona intestinalis</em> or the distinctive star-shaped patter of <em>Botryllus schlosseri</em> for one to wear on their French cuffs.  So I began to search further afield.  I&rsquo;ll give away the ending right here, I&rsquo;m going with <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/46347410/14kt-gold-sea-urchin-cuff-links-accl1038">these urchin cufflinks by Ashley Childs actually cast from urchin tests</a>, but, I thought you all might be interested to see some of the lovely, beautiful pieces I found along the way.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_853&rdquo; align=&quot;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&quot;560&rdquo; caption=&quot;Nothing says style and elegance like a piece of urchin test adorning your wrist.&quot;]<a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/46347410/14kt-gold-sea-urchin-cuff-links-accl1038"><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/urchinlink.jpeg" alt=""></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Phylum Echinodermata, Class Echinoidea</strong>
While the ones I&rsquo;m going with are cast from tests, it is not for lack of trying to find cufflinks made from actual tests.  I&rsquo;ve long coveted <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/76898378/sea-urchin-collection-cool-brown">these</a> made from small urchin tests found washed ashore.  Sadly, they are only available in pink, green, and brown, and won&rsquo;t match anything else color-wise at the wedding.  (What, I used to be in theater, so design is <em>very</em> important.)</p>
<p>So, cast or inspired it is.  I really liked <a href="http://jscssec.dy.ctscdn.com/shoponline/product.aspx?folderId=/discover/celebrityandevents&amp;itemid=N0BPH">these urchin-styled cufflinks by David Yurman</a>, but, sadly, silver, which clashes with the purple &amp; gold thing we&rsquo;re going for.  Also, <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/63350108/urchin-handmade-silver-cuff-links">these slightly more abstract urchin &lsquo;links</a> were awesome, but, likewise, silver. (See also this <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/32735882/urchin-fine-silver-ring">great ring by the same artist</a>).</p>
<p>So, gold (or, rather, plated).  I thought <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/TIFFANY-CO-Unusual-18K-Gold-Sea-Urchin-Cufflinks-/300502944319?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item45f75f0a3f">these</a> were elegant and lovely, but Tiffany and waaay too pricey for me.  Similarly, <a href="http://www.cuff-daddy.com/cufflinks-stud-formal-set-mens-accessories-gold-cz.html">these were great</a>, and had a maching studset, but, a little plain.  So, if I was going to go urchin, I was going to go with the cast piece.</p>
<p><strong>Phylum Echinodermata, Various Classes</strong></p>
<p>That said, I was not quite ready to give up on echinoderms.  On a bit of whimsy I tried searching for some Sea Cucumber ones.  No dice.  Sand dollars turned up a few interesting <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/77349176/sand-dollar-cuff-links">natural</a> or <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/54323724/sterling-silver-sand-dollar-cufflinks">cast</a> ones.  I&rsquo;ve never studied sand dollars, though, so&hellip;I continued looking.  What about <em>Pycnopodia</em>?  No dice for the multi-armed beast.  However, I did turn up some cool <a href="http://www.antiquejewelrymall.com/starcuflinin.html"><em>Pisaster</em>-like ones</a> as well as a few more <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/53747832/starfish-cufflinks">abstract</a>.  There were even a few made from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/75311010/sugar-stars-starfish-cuff-links">beach drift</a> (I hope) (and that person&rsquo;s store is <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShellScapes?section_id=6605643">full of similar neat stuff</a>), but nothing really caught me like the urchin test cufflinks.</p>
<p><strong>Phylum Mollusca, Class Gastropoda</strong>
What about getting out of Echinoderms all together, and going with mollusks?  Surely, there must be many gastropod-inspired cufflinks out there.  And there are!  Many are just ho-hum plain seashells, though.  Some, though, are exquisite, such as <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/26346081/conch-shell-cufflinks">these conch shells</a>, which really could do for any whelk biologist.  Or <a href="http://www.daniellemeshorer.com/categories/index.php?catID=005#">these silver lovelies by Danielle Meshorer</a> which reminded me of nothing so much as our Californian <em>Lithopoma</em>.  There were also some great ones made from <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/75860391/nautica-lineata-lined-moonsnail-seashell">actual shells</a>.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_854&rdquo; align=&quot;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&quot;595&rdquo; caption=&quot;I&rsquo;d say these were second place.  They&rsquo;re pretty fabulous.  And pointy, so, useful to stab unruly wedding guests.&quot;]<a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/26346081/conch-shell-cufflinks"><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/conchlink.jpeg" alt=""></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Phylum Mollusca, Class Cephalopoda</strong>
Now, like a good nerdy marine ecologist with slightly steampunkish leanings, the question begs: why not cephalopods.  Indeed, I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kraken-China-Mieville/dp/034549749X">Kraken</a>, and do annually celebrate Cephalopodmas.  A search for <a href="http://www.etsy.com/search/handmade?search_submit=&amp;q=squid+cufflink">squid cufflinks</a> can turn up a lot, but many of them are cameos or kinda kitchy.  Instead, what really impressed me in cephalopods was <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/66556312/fathers-day-steampunk-octopus-cufflinks">Octopus cufflinks</a>.  This particular version with a hole in the head popped up all over the place, and is really rather stylish.  Or you can find <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/63988709/octopus-cufflinks-and-tie-tack-set-of-3">this set with a matching tie pin</a>.  Or even get into something <a href="http://www.perfectcufflinks.com/Gunmetal-Octopus-Cufflinks-Cuff-Links/M/B004TZSFUE.htm">a little more abstract</a>.  I liked them, but, eh.  As I&rsquo;ve never studied cephalopods, I felt like I should be true to my roots.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_855&rdquo; align=&quot;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&quot;379&rdquo; caption=&quot;What gothy Cthonic octopodes these are!&quot;]<a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/66556312/fathers-day-steampunk-octopus-cufflinks"><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/octolinks.jpeg" alt=""></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Phylum Arthropoda, Class Malacostraca</strong>
I have, however, spend a lot of time with crabs and lobsters.  Crabs also made a lot of sense as I am a boy Baltimore bred.  The crab cufflinks out there are all <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/75123667/crabby-cufflinks-raw-brass-crab">very classy</a>, if I do say so.  I think my favorites just featured <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/61757304/crab-claw-cufflinks-sterling-silver">claws</a>.  Some where very cool and <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/76299539/tiny-crab-cufflinks">artsy</a>.  Other&rsquo;s more <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/73971009/clockwork-crab-steampunk-cufflinks">steampunky</a>.  But nothing that really grabbed me.  Similarly while there were some wonderful <a href="http://www.cuff-daddy.com/fun-lobster-silver-cufflinks-with-polished-chrome-finish.html">silver</a> and <a href="http://www.cufflinks1786.co.uk/lobster-with-feelers.html">gold</a> lobsters out there (and some quite pricey!), nothing really said, yes, I am what you want on your wrist when you say &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_856&rdquo; align=&quot;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&quot;600&rdquo; caption=&quot;I like to pinch.&quot;]<a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/61757304/crab-claw-cufflinks-sterling-silver"><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/clawlinks.jpeg" alt=""></a>[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Fin</strong>
So, really, it came down to urchins.  I mean, nothing says commitment like the commitment of a ravening spiky beast gnawing through an entire kelp forest.  That takes desire, work, perseverance, and a lot of love&hellip;of kelp.  An apt metaphor, no?  Well, at least my future wife will get a chuckle out of that one.  I hope.  And given the elegance, whimsy, and biological accuracy of the urchin test cufflinks, I think it&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going to go.  But for the rest o&rsquo; ye, enjoy what I&rsquo;ve listed here, and if you&rsquo;ve found anything that you feel is truly amazing, please, post it!  Also, I&rsquo;m still looking for studs&hellip;</p>
