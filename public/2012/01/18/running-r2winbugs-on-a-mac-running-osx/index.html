            <p>I have long used <a href="http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/">JAGS</a> to do all of my Bayesian work on my mac.  Early on, I tried to figure out how to install <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml">WinBUGS</a> and <a href="http://www.openbugs.info/w/">OpenBUGS</a> and their accompanying R libraries on my mac, but, to no avail.  I just had too hard of a time getting them running and gave up.</p>
<p>But, it would seem that some things have changed with <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> lately, and it is now possible to not only get WinBUGS itself running nicely on a mac, but to also get R2WinBUGS to run as well.  Or at least, so I have discovered after an absolutely heroic (if I do say so myself) effort to get it all running (this was to help out some students I&rsquo;m teaching who wanted to be able to do the same exercises as their windows colleagues).  So, I present the steps that I&rsquo;ve worked out.  I do not promise this will work for everyone - and in fact, if it fails at some point, I want to know about it so that perhaps we can fix it so that more people can get WinBUGS up and running.</p>
<p>Or just run JAGS (step 1} install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/">the latest version</a>, step 2} install rjags in R.  Modify your code slightly.  Run it.  Be happy.)</p>
<p>So, this tutorial works to get the whole WinBUGS shebang running.  Note that it hinges on installing the latest development version of Wine, not the stable version (at least as of 1/17/12).  If you have previously installed wine using macports, good on you.  Now uninstall it with &ldquo;sudo port uninstall wine&rdquo;.  Otherwise, you will not be able to do this.</p>
<p>Away we go!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have the free version of XCode Installed from <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">http://developer.apple.com/xcode/</a>.  You may have to sign up for an apple developer account.  Whee!  You&rsquo;re a developer now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have X11 Installed from your system install disc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install [http://www.macports.org/install.php](<a href="http://www.macports.org/%3Emacports">http://www.macports.org/&gt;macports</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> following the guide at &lt;a href=) and install from the package installer.  See also <a href="http://guide.macports.org/#installing">here</a> for more information. Afterwards, open the terminal and type</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You will be asked for your password.  Don&rsquo;t worry that it doesn&rsquo;t display anything as you type. Press enter when you&rsquo;ve finished typing your password.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Open your terminal and type</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Go have a cup of coffe, check facebook, or whatever you do while the install chugs away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download WinBUGS 1.4.x from <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml">here</a>.  Also download the immortality key and the patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open your terminal, and type</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note, if you have changed your download directory, you will need to type in the path to the directory where you download files now (e.g., Desktop).</p>
<p>8 ) Follow the instructions to install WinBUGS into c:Program Files.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Run WinBUGS via the terminal as follows:</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>After first running WinBUGS, install the immortality key.  Close WinBUGS.  Open it again as above and install the patch.  Close it.  Open it again and WinBUGS away!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To now use R2WinBugs fire up R and install the R2WinBUGS library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R2WinBugs should now work normally with one exception.  When you use the bugs function, you will need to supply the following additional argument:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>filling in your username where indicated.  If you don&rsquo;t know it, in the terminal type</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>No, ~ will not work for those of you used to it.  Don&rsquo;t ask me why.</p>
