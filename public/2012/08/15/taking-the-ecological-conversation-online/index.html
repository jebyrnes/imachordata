            <p>At ESA this year, I gave a talk in a symposium about changing the culture of ecology.  The talk was entitled <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/JarrettByrnes/taking-the-ecological-conversation-online"><em>Taking the Ecological Conversation Online</em></a> and summarized what I thought were the benefits of engaging in online activities.  As this was a scientific audience interested in how we might change the culture of Ecology to improve our science, I focused the talk not on what I feel are the outreach &amp; public engagement benefits of going online - those are both obvious and legion. Rather, I focused on how I felt that interacting with other scientists online via blogs, Twitter, stackexchange sites, and more actually <em>improve your science</em>.</p>
<p>I got a great positive response.  A number of folk even told me they would now get on twitter - maybe just to follow a few people, maybe to talk themselves - or start following a few blogs, as they could see how this would benefit them.  This warmed the cockles of my heart - particularly given that I was super nervous about giving this talk, as it was pretty much data free (with one or two exceptions).</p>
<p>For those not at ESA, I&rsquo;ve put the slides on slideshare, and you can see them below.</p>
