<p>A service that is travelling along similar lines of <a href="http://www.imachordata.com/?p=1132">what I&rsquo;m interested in for open publishing</a> has launched today.  <a href="http://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a> is being pitched as a cross between PLoS ONE and arXiv and indeed the company was founded by former  PLoS ONE and Mendeley folk.  It&rsquo;s an interesting model where authors signup with a pre-paid plan.  $99 gets you unlimited public preprints and 1 peer reviewed paper per year.  $169 adds unlimited private preprints and another paper per year.  $259 ups you to unlimited publications.  And its nice as you can chose to pay once your paper is accepted (see <a href="https://www.peerj.com/how-it-works/">how it works</a>) so an author isn&rsquo;t just being fleeced.  There also appear to be reasonable plans for large numbers of co-authors etc.  They also require members to review once per year.  Nice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still reading through all of the materials about it myself, and there&rsquo;s a lot here to digest and meditate on.  It still appears that review is not open - both before and after &lsquo;publication&rsquo; - although you can publish the review-trail and previous versions along with the finished product if you&rsquo;d like.  But in general, this is pretty fantastic</p>
<p>Here are some links about the launch and useful additional reading.  I&rsquo;d love to know what folk out there think.  Will you be using it?  Time to <a href="https://twitter.com/researchremix/status/212559845021327360">put our money where our #openaccess mouths are?</a>  I&rsquo;m thinking yes!</p>

<p>My question to you all - does this new entry to the publishing market solve everything?  Is it a panacea?  Are there things you wish it did better, or is it just the right balance?</p>
