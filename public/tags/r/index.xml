      <title>Modelbased for Quick and Beautiful Model Visualization</title>

      <description>A year ago, I found the modelbased package while looking for tools to visualize some mixed models. It was a minor revelation. Just like many of the packages from the [easystats]((https://easystats.github.io/) family.
I teach students to simulate the data they want for data viz (yay broom::augment() and modelr::data_grid()), and then plot that in combination with raw data (sometimes). This is great for really detailed nit-picky figures. But, particularly for students just learning, or for a quick-and-dirty data viz of a fit multivariate model, I always wished there was a simpler way.</description>

      <description>I always forget how to write function that dynamically evaluate variables in a tidyverse context. This post is a reminder mostly for myself. But maybe you will find it useful, too?</description>

      <description>How can I run Tensorflow in R on my new M1 Mac without it being a crash-fest? I ran into this problem, and, after a few months of people mucking about, I think there is an answer!</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s All Go Down to the Barplot!</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back for another pean to ANOVA-loving experimental ecology. Barplots (or point-range plots - but which is better is a discussion for a different time) are the thing! And a friend of mine was recently asking me how to do a decent barplot with ggplot2 for data of moderate complexity (e.g., a 2-way ANOVA).
So I tried it.
And then I hit my head against a wall for a little while.</description>

      <description>OK, so, I know I already raved about one Hadley Wickham project and how it has changed my life last week. But what can I say, the man is a genius. And if you are using R (and let&amp;rsquo;s face it, you should be) and you want simple sexy graphs made quick, the man has you covered once again.
I first learned about ggplot2 while scanning through some slides of the LA Area RUG meetings (that I missed - I still haven&amp;rsquo;t been to any!</description>

      <title>Sometimes, you just need to use a plyr</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted anything about R-nerdery in quite some time. But I have to pause for a moment, and sing the praises of a relatively new package that has made my life exponentially easier. The plyr package.
R has the capability to apply a single function to a vector or list using apply or mapply, or their various derivatives. This returns another vector or list.
This is great in principal, but in practice, with indexing, odd return objects, and difficulties in using multiple arguments, it can get out of hand for complex functions.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming of webs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking myself, how do we visualize the hidden complexity of the natural world? This is not an idle question, but draws on some of my current research. It is vital to how we think about ecosystems when we attempt to preserve and restore them. It is inherently beautiful, in and of itself.
Most of us are familiar with the concept of a food chain.</description>
