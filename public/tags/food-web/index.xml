      <description>Yay! First paper of my postdoc is out in the August 2011 issue of Global Change Biology!
Woohoo!
So, what have I been doing for the past few years of my life?
In brief summary: Kelp. Food webs. Climate change. A potent combination.
And if you want the punchline without digging into the rest of this article, it is this: the diverse, complex food webs of southern California kelp forest will likely be greatly simplified if climate change leads to big storms every year.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming of webs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking myself, how do we visualize the hidden complexity of the natural world? This is not an idle question, but draws on some of my current research. It is vital to how we think about ecosystems when we attempt to preserve and restore them. It is inherently beautiful, in and of itself.
Most of us are familiar with the concept of a food chain.</description>
