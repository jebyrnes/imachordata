      <description>I really liked the power analysis example I gave in class today. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m finally firing on all cylinders with the tidyverse. So I thought I would post it here, in case it was of use to anyone!
Power OK, we can fit and evluate linear regression models, but what about their power? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at our seal fit again - maybe we want to know what would have happened with a lower sample size?</description>
