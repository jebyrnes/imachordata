      <description>It seems that blogs, twitter, etc, are beginning to really leak into the consciousness of ecologists! In two weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m attending the LTER All Scientists Meeting (ASM). As I browsed through the working grounp lists, I came across the following: Blogs, Posts, and Tweets: Potential Uses of Web-Based and Social Networking Media for Communicating LTER Science and Conducting Citizen Science.
Tres cool.
The LTER network, for those unfamiliar, is perhaps the oldest network of Long Term Ecological Research projects, well, anywhere.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note - after leaving Davis, the server for this blog went down. This is the new home (like the domain name?)
The old content will be back once I get the old server in the mail. In the meantime, I have returned! New content soon&amp;hellip;</description>
