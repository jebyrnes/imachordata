<p>Wonder no more!  The gray literature, formerly that stuff that scientists hold in vague contempt but often turn to for absolutely crucial basic information, is now starting to come online.</p>
<p>I discovered this talking to the amazing library staff at Moss Landing Marine Lab.  There, they are part of an effort called <a href="http://aquacomm.fcla.edu/">Aquatic Commons</a>, which is putting reports online from a variety of US and international agencies.  MLML is specifically working up the California Department of Fish and Game collection.</p>
<p>This is in turn feeding into <a href="http://www.ifremer.fr/avano/">Avano</a>, a marine and aquatic science literature search engine which hits both the grey and the white literature.</p>
<p>And there really are some gems, such as <a href="http://aquacomm.fcla.edu/1965/">Don Abbbott&rsquo;s undergrad report on the littoral ascidians of Monterey Bay</a> before he went on to co-author <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intertidal-Invertebrates-California-Robert-Harding/dp/0804710457">Intertidal Invertebrates of California</a>, <a href="http://aquacomm.fcla.edu/149/">early studies of the impact of the Diablo Canyon power plant</a> which shaped much of how we monitor biological impacts,or, my personal favorite, <a href="http://aquacomm.fcla.edu/1999/">Purgatorio - two rather different views of the same event</a> which I excerpt from below:</p>
