      If you&rsquo;re looking at growth in Laminaria (or Saccharina) kelps, and need to make a barplot&hellip;why bother with the bar, really? Why not make it a kelp plot!

      It is cocktail week over at Deep Sea News. And it has been glorious, with marine biology themed cocktails galore. As a cocktilian myself, I felt that I had to kick in, well, a real classic. I classic that, I daresay, may lay at the root of kelp forest ecology itself. And yet may be under threat.
&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; I hear you saying. Let me explain.
Kelps are incredible. I mean, this is a clade of algae with members who can grow a foot per day, that form giant forests that rival the redwoods in beauty, that embrace diversity looking like everything from a mini-palm-tree to a majestic pair of antlers 60 feet high, to a lasagna noodle.

      I&rsquo;m so stoked that the white abalone breeding project at BML, my phdalmamater (as it were), is rocketing forward. And I&rsquo;m even more excited to see Dr. Kris Aquilino, one of my former labmates, talking about the work and communicating science LIKE A BOSS!

      WARNING: This blog entry contains me awkwardly groping with math. It&rsquo;s not pretty. It&rsquo;s not done elegantly - indeed, for problems of even moderate complexity I fired up maxima (which is totally awesome!) rather than screw up the algebra on paper. And there are a few leaps that I make that I&rsquo;m sure someone could write a proof for, but, well&hellip; While I fall somewhere in the middle of the theoretical - experimental axis of scientists, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s something I do every day, so, expect some turbulence.

      Hey, all! For the rest of the month, I&rsquo;m the Scientist in Residence over at The Deep Sea News! Muchas gracias to Rick, Miriam, Kevin, and the rest of the crew for bringing me on board. My first post is up where I discuss some of my work on How are extinctions and invasions shaping food webs?
Also, contrary to what Rick may have you believe, I&rsquo;m at NCEAS, not NESCent.

      Why does it take so long for awesome cutting-edge statistical to make their way over to ecology? There are a myriad of techniques out there that have been around for 20, 30, 40, or more years that could help so many ecologists from banging their head into a wall over and over and over and&hellip;well, you get the point. But, it takes quite a while for them to percolate over to us.

      I just learned that Lawrence Slobodkin passed away last week. Slobodkin was one of the authors of the infamous HSS paper in 1960 that has shaped how we think of the role of predators in ecosystems for decades. Indeed, it is one of the very origins of the modern concept of trophic cascades. More than that, though, this was a man with broad ranging interests in biology. I think the New York Times Obit has some interesting points about his contribution to our understanding of the world, and includes this quote from Slobodkin:

      It seems that blogs, twitter, etc, are beginning to really leak into the consciousness of ecologists! In two weeks, I&rsquo;m attending the LTER All Scientists Meeting (ASM). As I browsed through the working grounp lists, I came across the following: Blogs, Posts, and Tweets: Potential Uses of Web-Based and Social Networking Media for Communicating LTER Science and Conducting Citizen Science.
Tres cool.
The LTER network, for those unfamiliar, is perhaps the oldest network of Long Term Ecological Research projects, well, anywhere.

      For those who aren&rsquo;t following it, the SEAPLEX cruise blog is pretty amazing. SEAPLEX is a cruise being led by none other than Miriam Goldstein of The Oyster&rsquo;s Garter to explore the Great North Pacific Trash Gyre.

OK, so, a gyre of trash may not be that great, but, you know, it&rsquo;s Great. As in Awesome. By which I mean Awe-inspiring kinda Great.
