      <description>Positive Multifunctionality ≠ All Functions Are Positive
I was dismayed this morning to read Bradford et al.&amp;lsquo;s recently accepted paper Discontinuity in the responses of ecosystem processes and multifunctionality to altered soil community composition in PNAS for several reasons.
The paper itself is really cool. They manipulated community complexity and nutrient conditions in the Ecotron, and then looked at five soil ecosystem functions. They then looked at whether complexity influenced multi functionality (as well as N), and found, indeed, it did!</description>

      <title>Getting it Right - after Publication: A Multifunctional Journey?</title>

      <description>Sometimes, you have to publish a paper to have the hit-yourself-in-the-head revelation of the real right answer.
Earlier this year, along with a great cohort of colleagues, I birthed a really neat piece summarizing how you can look at simultaneous change in multiple ecosystem functions. We were interested in how changes in diversity can affect the simultaneous performance of multiple functions, but, really, anything can be put on the X axis - warming, fertilization, lemony-fresh-scentedness - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.</description>

      <description>This is x-posted from my guest post at Deep Sea News about the new Floating Forests citizen science project I&amp;rsquo;m part of. If you&amp;rsquo;re excited about it, go check out http://www.floatingforests.org/!
There&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted. Something that would take kelp forest science to a new level. Something that would let me do the kind of work that I dream about, quietly, secretly, peering into the mysteries of kelpiness.
It is something impossible.</description>

      <description>While working more on the bacterial network stuff, Jen and I realized I was wrong. Yep, I was wrong on the internet. Namely, in my post on bacterial networks, I got the answer wrong on the abundance of OTUs with different degrees of specialization. I had a rowSum after inverting a matrix instead of before, producing wonky vertex sizes. Jen cleverly discovered it when totaling up some of the data by hand, and after alerting me to the issue I produced the following plot which doesn&amp;rsquo;t agree with the network at all:</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;So,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m sure you aren&amp;rsquo;t wondering, how did that creating &amp;lsquo;ecospecies&amp;rsquo; from bacterial sequences based on sequence similarity, co-occurrence, and network theory work out for you?&amp;rdquo;
Quite well, thanks for asking! Heck, have a git repository, why dontcha!
Jen is furiously writing the manuscript, but, the technique indeed seems to indicate that 12% sequence similarity was the optimal number.
Once we got that down, and started plotting the network with individual Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) each connected to one or more of the 8 plots they were found in, we started seeing some neat things.</description>

      <description>Last day of dives before heading back. We hit two sites on either side of the northern head of Appledore. It&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable break, as on one side you have fairly decent expsore to waves from the West. On the other, things are fairly protected. So, there&amp;rsquo;s a strong physical gradient. And, though perhaps just a few hundred meters apart, the two sites could not be more different. At the first site, the photos didn&amp;rsquo;t come out terribly well, but this gives you a general sense -</description>

      <description>The second site of the day was a surprise. 10 years ago, Smith&amp;rsquo;s Cove was a mixed mussel bed and urchin barren. Previous, it has been a Codium meadow. Now&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s just a giant red algal carpet. Wall to wall. Thick, easily fragmenting, ubiquitous, invasive red Heterosiphonia japonica. Also, big tufts of Ulva. And some other bushy filamentous algae scattered about, along with a few crabs.
What a weird landscape. What is that red carpet doing?</description>

      <description>Well, today was it. After a 2 year hiatus behind my computer screen, my skin now softer and more delicate from its soothing rays, I hopped back in the water FOR SCIENCE! Not only that, but it was my return to dry suit diving. Oh, dry suit diving. I really didn&amp;rsquo;t miss you and your weird buoyancy tricks (note to self, get ankle weights, as old ones have desintegrated).
It was a great day, despite feeling kinda like the first day back at school.</description>

      <description>So, today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to catch a ferry out to the Shoals Marine Lab. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to be out for a day to meet with the undergrad intern I&amp;rsquo;m mentoring. I&amp;rsquo;ll be back later this summer to work with her and setup some permanent monitoring transects.
I have to be honest, this is one of those moments in my life where I am watching a dream come through. I went to SML in the summer of 1999 to take some classes.</description>

      <description>So, I recently submitted a piece regarding the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology &amp;amp; Evolutionary Biology. Simultaneous to posting, I put up a preprint in PeerJ Preprints and also put it on Google Docs for line by line commentary (which you are welcome to give!). I asked in both places that commenters identify themselves, unless they felt deeply uncomfortable.
OMG the experience has been amazing!
At PeerJ you can comment on the main page of the article, and others can rate it - which is fantastic - and I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten some wonderful feedback there (thanks Lars!</description>

      <description>x-post from the OpenPub Project blog
So, we got together, had two working group meetings to discuss the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and the Earth and Ocean Sciences. What were were thinking that entire time?
We&amp;rsquo;ve just submitted a piece that brings together our broad ideas (some of which have been seen before), but, simultaneous to publication, we&amp;rsquo;ve also decided to put up a preprint. Why? Simply put, immediate access is one of our four pillars of the future of scholarly publication.</description>

      <description>So, Internet, I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a number of monitoring sites this summer. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get good wave height measurements from them to look at disturbance. I have yet to find something like the CDIP swell height model for the Gulf of Maine (although, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear that this is due to a failure of my google-fu). So, I&amp;rsquo;m casting about for some good wave height sensors.
The problem I face is that I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy a lot of them, and in some highly variable conditions, secured to subtidal transects.</description>

[latex]A_rgs ~ Poisson(\frac{A_rg}{S_g})[/latex]
In the analysis I&amp;rsquo;m doing, interesting, the results do change a bit such that the original network only results are confirmed.</description>

I think it has some generality to it, and I&amp;rsquo;d love any feedback from the more mathematical crowd&amp;hellip;I also wrote it to make sure I knew what I was doing - translating scribbled equations to code to results - so it does freeflow a bit. It may change based on feedback - consider this a working document.</description>

      <description>Everyone has been pretty shocked by the devastation wreaked by Sandy. Here in New England, we also got a Nor&amp;rsquo;easter following a few days later. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of intense storm action in a short period of time.
So I was quite curious as I ventured out into the field last weekend to see how things looked. I went on a potential field site scouting trip to UMB&amp;rsquo;s field station in Nantucket.</description>

      <description>Does Synthesis Ecology exist? Is it a discipline? If so, what is it? If not, why not?
As a part of the Trends in Ecological Analysis and Synthesis symposium here at NCEAS, several postdocs past and present organized by Jennifer &amp;ldquo;Firestarter&amp;rdquo; Balch got together and sent this survey to the last 15 years of NCEAS postdocs. The survey asks what current and former NCEAS postdocs thought were the most important contributions in Synthesis Ecology and what they thought were the most exciting future directions in Synthesis Ecology.</description>

      <description>We know that warming, storms, drought, acidification, and the myriad of other effects of climate change will impact natural ecosystems. Most of our studies have concentrated on direct effects, though. For example, if you change temperature, you alter herbivore grazing rates. But what about indirect effects? For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that increased intense storm frequency may remove kelp which will have an indirect effect on the structure of kelp forest food webs.</description>

OK, last but on two-level food webs for the moment. I&amp;rsquo;ve examined how food web structure can change the effects of predator or prey extinctions on both top-down and bottom-up control. A number of folk (including me) have theorized that changes in diversity at two trophic levels should interact - that the consequences of predator diversity loss should change as prey species are lost.</description>

To begin tackling the question of &amp;ldquo;How does the structure of a food web influence the consequences of extinction? let&amp;rsquo;s begin by thinking about how changes in the number of predator species in a simple 2-level predator-prey food web can influence 1) the probability of prey being eaten and 2) the amount of energy transfered to the predator group.</description>

      <description>So, we know that species are going extinct at a pretty stunning rate. Mostly by human activities. The natural question is, will this affect the function of the natural world? You may well say &amp;lsquo;Duh! Of course!&amp;rsquo; as a first instinctive pass, but, the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t so clear cut - will species that survive simply take up the slack? What&amp;rsquo;s the value of a &amp;lsquo;species&amp;rsquo; anyway?
Starting in the late &amp;rsquo;90s the field of diversity-function research has tackled this topic, largely using manipulations plant species number.</description>

Woohoo!
So, what have I been doing for the past few years of my life?
In brief summary: Kelp. Food webs. Climate change. A potent combination.
And if you want the punchline without digging into the rest of this article, it is this: the diverse, complex food webs of southern California kelp forest will likely be greatly simplified if climate change leads to big storms every year.</description>

      <description>I recently attended the DISCCRS symposium for recent PhDs of a wide variety of disciplines whose work (past or present) deals with climate change. The week-long meeting was phenomenal, seeding me with thoughts, ideas, and basically making me feel quite good about the work I&amp;rsquo;m doing (if also very pessimistic about how society is dealing with Climate Change). Perhaps one of the most interesting exercises of the whole thing was something we had to do as a sort of getting-to-know-you.</description>

      <description>There is nothing like that pain of taking a first look at fresh precious new data from a carefully designed experiment which took months of planning and construction, 8 divers working full days, and a lot of back-and-forth with colleagues, and then you find absolutely no patterns of interest.
Yup, it&amp;rsquo;s a real takes-your-breath-away-hand-me-a-beer kind of moment. Fortunately, I was on my way to a 4th of July dinner with my family up in the mountains of Colorado, so, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite going to commit hari-kari on the spot.</description>

      <description>I love modeling! I love modeling! Modeling will solve everything!
Let&amp;rsquo;s model the spatial distribution of Bigfoot!
WAIT, WHAT?!
Figure 1 from the paper. Foots denote sighting of Sasquatch footprints. Circles for just visual/auditory sightings. I ask, how does one know what Bigfoot sounds like?
Yes, it sounds silly, but in the current issue of the Journal of Biogegraphy, Lozier et al give us their stunning contribution Predicting the distribution of Sasquatch in western North America: anything goes with ecological niche modelling.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing so satisfying as pulling back and seeing your brand new experiment out there in the water.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy week or three getting this up and running, but now my first big postdoctoral experiment is soaking in the water, with urchins grazing away.
I&amp;rsquo;m testing some ideas regarding how diversity mediates the impact of disturbance by urchin grazing, and vice-versa - how disturbance by grazing can alter diversity.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been dreaming of webs.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking myself, how do we visualize the hidden complexity of the natural world? This is not an idle question, but draws on some of my current research. It is vital to how we think about ecosystems when we attempt to preserve and restore them. It is inherently beautiful, in and of itself.
Most of us are familiar with the concept of a food chain.</description>

      <description>Oh! Excitement! My dissertation has been posted online by Proquest. Clearly, according to the internet, I must actually be a Doctor. Thanks, Internet!
Of course, looking at the page, the internet also thinks I am a Limnologist, but, well, we&amp;rsquo;ll let that one slide.
(now if only those copies of the dissertation that I ordered months ago would show up&amp;hellip;)</description>
