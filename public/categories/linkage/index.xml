      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a mixed week, which has caused me to reflect on two beautiful posts - and put them here so that I don&amp;rsquo;t lose them.

      <description>As someone who, admittedly, benefitted a great deal from Privilege growing up (it definitely lowered the barriers to my becoming a succesful marine scientist), know that this is true of MANY Ecology and Evolutionary Biology folk, and now think a good deal about how I can lower those barriers for students and mentees that come under my aegis, you should all go over and check out Miriam Goldstein&amp;rsquo;s A field guide to privilege in marine science: some reasons why we lack diversity.</description>
