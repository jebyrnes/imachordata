      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve long been pretty stoked that Methods in Ecology and Evolution has a blog. And now the upstart crew over at Oikos is getting into the online game with their delightful offering. Go check it out!
Update: Believe it or not, I titled this post before the latest at Jabberwocky. Great minds, I say.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been totally stoked that Jai Ranganathan&amp;rsquo;s science podcast Voyage of the Beagle has been rebooted as Curiouser and Curiouser and that its first episode was on the science of overfishing. I contacted the folk over at DSN about it, and they kindly let me add a guest post. Yay! Check it out, and enjoy Jai&amp;rsquo;s podcasts!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of year where we ocean bloggers band together for the cause of Marine Environmental Education in US Schools. Between now and Nov 9th, we&amp;rsquo;re running a drive through Donor&amp;rsquo;s Choose in order to indoctrinate educate schoolkids in the wonders of the sea. Last year was a huge success, bringing in thousands of dollars to underfunded schools and enabling some real discovery. This donation is tax deductible, so, please, make a difference and donate (anything!</description>

      <title>Help Kids Learn Sea Chanties!</title>

      <description>As a young tyke growing up around the decaying maritime glories of Baltimore, I was lucky to sail aboard The Lady Maryland. The feel and scent of her wooden decks, polished brass, and wet wool still haunt me, actually. Those voyages were coupled with a feisty choir teacher, John &amp;ldquo;Doc&amp;rdquo; Merrill, who taught me my first few Sea Chanties. (and we all know where that led&amp;hellip;)
While I loved the marine world from a deeply emotional place at the time (my Aunt had been an underwater photographer before passing away), and loved science because, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, I was an enormous nerd, Tall Ships and Sea Chanties are what made me fall in love with The Sea.</description>

      <title>I&#39;m an Editor?</title>

      <description>So, someone over at researchblogging.org was decidedly foolish, and asked me to be one of their new editors-at-large for Biology. That means, every Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting the three biology (typically ecology and evolution) research paper reviews linked through researchblogging.org that I enjoyed the most. My first post is up, and hopefully there will be many more to come!</description>

      <description>HAPPY BIRTHDAY DARWIN! On the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Lord, Master, and all around Deity of Ecology &amp;amp; Evolutionary Biology (right?), I can only offer up my humble prayers. What better place than a strange shrine to Darwin in Puerto Ayora in the Galapagos. (Yes, that is me. You have no idea how happy it made some adorable little old ladies to be asked to take this photo.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note - after leaving Davis, the server for this blog went down. This is the new home (like the domain name?)
The old content will be back once I get the old server in the mail. In the meantime, I have returned! New content soon&amp;hellip;</description>
