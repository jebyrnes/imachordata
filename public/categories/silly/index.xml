      <description>Because there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been enough ocean silliness lately&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve long been a fan of Ze Frank. But who knew that one of the next places he&amp;rsquo;d be turning his razor sharp with was on the natural world. And not only that, but, he&amp;rsquo;d make sure everything is pretty much scientifically kosher. So, I give you three things that nearly made me laugh so hard I was almost glad I wasn&amp;rsquo;t in a drysuit (because tight neck seals and laughing = no fun?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a mixed week, which has caused me to reflect on two beautiful posts - and put them here so that I don&amp;rsquo;t lose them.
First, the evolution of dealing with a paper being rejected through your career.
And, naturally, the evolution of having your paper accepted throughout your career.</description>

      <description>Another excellent piece describing the intricacies of a complex field of scientific inquiry from Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, as always.
.
Ah, parasitology. So glad that a certain someone makes sure it gets its day in the sun over at SMBC. And that the two of them have an awesome podcast.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s always good to see some rockin&amp;rsquo; Science Music videos coming from my alma mater. The use of crabs here? Genius. Also great to see the Big Man Himself making a special guest appearance.
Enjoy!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty stoked about the This is What a Scientist Looks Like project on tumblr. So much so that I felt compelled to submit an (old) photo of me doing field work. I mean, when one things science, they often think labcoats and microscopes. When one thinks ecology, they often think hiking in a forest or working out on a sunny grassland. (note: these are impressions I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to people when I say these words - not what I think myself, natch.</description>

      <description>I am part of an incredibly exciting project - the #SciFund Challenge. #SciFund is an attempt to have scientists link their work to the general public through crowdfunding. As I&amp;rsquo;m one of the organizers, I thought I should have some skin in the game. But what skin?
Well, people are pitching some incredibly sexy projects - tracking puffin migrations, coral reefs conservation,snake-squirrel interactions (WITH ROBOSQUIRRELS!), mathematical modeling of movements like Occupy Wall Street, and many many more.</description>

      <description>Whew, it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit since I posted here. Rest assured, little sea squirts, there are some interesting new things in the works. Some things that are science-y (in which I try and use this blog as a sounding board/ lab notebook) and some things not so much.
In the not so much category, a ton of my time has lately been going to the organizing of the #SciFund challenge - a large initiative to try and crowdfunding for science!</description>

      <title>Cufflinks for the Well Dressed Marine Scientist</title>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;m-a-gettin&amp;rsquo; hitched in, what, just less that 6 weeks to a singularly lovely lady. As I determine the proper haute couture for the nuptials, I&amp;rsquo;ve begun to have fun with one piece in particular. Cuffilnks.
I mean, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to go Tux (and I do so love a good tuxedo), cufflinks are a must. But what kind of cufflinks should a gentleman marine biologist wear? Why, sea-creature themed, of course.</description>

      <description>Happy Half Tau Day to everyone! What&amp;rsquo;s that, you say? It&amp;rsquo;s Pi Day? Whatever. π is wrong. Need convincing? See the brilliant video by Vi Hart below and visit The Tau Manifesto.
So go out there, and celebrate the fact that you&amp;rsquo;re halfway to the day where you can make 2 Pi!
(And don&amp;rsquo;t worry, you should still make some π today! It&amp;rsquo;s delicious!)</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m having one of those days. One of those &amp;ldquo;I have a meeting that will finalize the analyses for a paper, let&amp;rsquo;s just check that ONE thing that didn&amp;rsquo;t matter in early versions of this model, so, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter now, and OMGWTFBBQ everything changed!&amp;rdquo; kinds of days. Well, OK, not everything - just the new piece of the story that intrigued me the most because it was so delightfully intuitive.</description>

      <title>Who&#39;s your (academic) (great-grand) Daddy?!</title>
      <link>/2009/10/14/whos-your-academic-daddy/</link>

      <description>Science is a giant family. Each Professor gives &amp;ldquo;birth&amp;rdquo; to a litter of PhD students over time, many of whom go on to have their own students, who have their own students, and so on and so forth ad infinitum.
While all of us know our academic parent (right?), at least some of our sciblings (depending on the age of the lab), and usually our academic grandparent, what about our great-grandparent?</description>

      <description>I love modeling! I love modeling! Modeling will solve everything!
Let&amp;rsquo;s model the spatial distribution of Bigfoot!
WAIT, WHAT?!
Figure 1 from the paper. Foots denote sighting of Sasquatch footprints. Circles for just visual/auditory sightings. I ask, how does one know what Bigfoot sounds like?
Yes, it sounds silly, but in the current issue of the Journal of Biogegraphy, Lozier et al give us their stunning contribution Predicting the distribution of Sasquatch in western North America: anything goes with ecological niche modelling.</description>
