      <description>OK, so, I spoke too soon. There are at least a few stabs by scientists writing about being a parent who studies climate/environmental change. As folk send me more, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and keep this list updated. While there&amp;rsquo;s some great stuff here, I feel like this is an empty niche for some great writing. Maybe you want to contribute, too? Towards that end, anyone who has a yen, I will be happy to post, repost, or link your own writings here under my science parent category.</description>

      <description>An old friend with a new child asked me if I know any climate change scientists or global change biologists who are parents and have written cogently about being parents in the era of climate change. Off of the top of my head, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t think of any (prove me wrong, internet), but, heck, I&amp;rsquo;m one myself. Here I am, staring down the barrel of hitting one year since HD&amp;rsquo;s arrival.</description>

      <description>_X-posted from SeaMonster, this video is so clear, and so compelling that I thought it needed to put it up as well - 12&amp;rdquo; increase by 2050 in SoCal?! Wow. And 36&amp;rdquo; by 2100 in SoCal&amp;hellip;lots to think about. _</description>
