      <description>So, rolling into year two here in the Biology Department at UMass Boston, I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m having a delightful time. Fabulous colleagues (who I&amp;rsquo;m already co-authoring papers with - that&amp;rsquo;s just how we roll), a easy access to multiple field sites and stations, a deliciously nerdy intellectual scene throughout Boston, a brand-spankin&amp;rsquo;-new School for the Environment, and a nice waterfront setting.
So, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that we&amp;rsquo;re hiring a disease ecologist/evolutionary biologist type in our department.</description>

      <description>Allright, folk! The final documents have been signed, sealed, and delivered. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;ll be starting a position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology at UMass Boston in the fall. That&amp;rsquo;s right, soon the Byrnes Lab is going to become a reality. Get ready, Science, because this is going to be an adventure!
