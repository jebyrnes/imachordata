      How to process something like Rafe Sagarin&rsquo;s senseless passing? For those who never encountered him, Rafe was a wonderful marine ecologist whose body of work was as varied and eclectic as can be, from classic papers on long-term effects of climate change in Science and Ecological Monograph to books on how the natural world can help us deal with risk, like terrorist attacks, to working at Biosphere2. He&rsquo;s even got a wonderful youtube channel that works, as he always did, outside of the box.

      OK, so, you&rsquo;re a scientist interested in jumping into the world of online social networking for interacting with colleagues, fun and profitbringing science to the world at large. Fantastic!
So, you log on, and are suddenly confronted by a dizzying array of sites you could use to communicate. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Myspace (yes, it&rsquo;s back), Blogspot, Wordpress, FriendFeed, Tumblr, &hellip;. I could go on for a while. And then you may also have concerns about mixing personal and private.

      A question for the peanut gallery -
I&rsquo;m starting to get a trickle of the interested-in-grad-school student emails. So far the few I&rsquo;ve gotten have been great. So, I&rsquo;m revising my prospective students page after noticing a few things in year one. The first was a lack of some students realizing that I wanted to know their interests beyond &lsquo;marine ecology&rsquo;. I wanted a research question - any question, no matter how broad - as having a question does not guarantee it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to follow in your graduate career.

      _This is a x-post from the blog I&rsquo;ve setup for my course blog. As my first class at UMB, I&rsquo;m teaching An Introduction to Computational Data Analysis for Biology - basically mixing teaching statistics and basic programming. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve thought a long time about teaching - although the rubber meeting the road has been fascinating.
As part of the course, I&rsquo;m adapting an exercise that I learned while taking English courses - in particular from a course on Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy.

      Does Synthesis Ecology exist? Is it a discipline? If so, what is it? If not, why not?
As a part of the Trends in Ecological Analysis and Synthesis symposium here at NCEAS, several postdocs past and present organized by Jennifer &ldquo;Firestarter&rdquo; Balch got together and sent this survey to the last 15 years of NCEAS postdocs. The survey asks what current and former NCEAS postdocs thought were the most important contributions in Synthesis Ecology and what they thought were the most exciting future directions in Synthesis Ecology.

      I admit it. I love big scientific meetings. There&rsquo;s something about the intense intellectual hubbub of thousands of my fields greatest minds gathered in one place for a few days of showing off the latest, greatest, flashiest work that just fills me with joy. Also a need to sleep for a week afterwards due to my brain going at a Matrix-like pace to keep up with all of the new and interesting information while spouting off ideas, critiques, beginning collaborations, and constantly questing to understand the growing shape of the research fields that interest me.

      There have been a steady stream of articles over the years stating that now is the time for Science to embrace Crowdfunding. It is the wave of the future, they state. It will link people to science directly. Abandon the shackles of the NSF and NIH, ye meek and mild mannered scientists. The internet is your salvation.
And along with this hoopla comes a small handfull of science crowdfunding sites, but few success stories.

      *-note, this was derived from a combination of emails between myself and my former phd advisor. See if you can pick out who is arguing what and where. It&rsquo;s fun - well, for some of you, anyway.
How do we know the world?
This is a seemingly simple and vast question - one with no answer. And yet, it is at the core of every single scientific endeavor. We make choices.

      Let&rsquo;s face it. The current journal system is slowly breaking down - in Ecology if not in other disciplines as well. The number of submissions is going up exponentially. At the same time, journals are finding it harder and harder to find reviewers. Statistics such as editors contacting 10 reviewers to find 3 are not uncommon. People don&rsquo;t respond, they take a long time to review, or just take a long time and THEN don&rsquo;t respond leading to a need for still more reviewers to be found (this has held up 2 of my pubs for 3+ extra months).

      As I am in the thick of job hunting season, I&rsquo;m writing a few applications. One of the most interesting parts of the whole process is the research statement. It&rsquo;s interesting as it forces one to really be self-reflective, and ask &ldquo;Who am I and why am I doing this?&rdquo; The first paragraph in particular is a sort of declaration. Hopefully this will be the last one of these I write, but, who am I kidding.
