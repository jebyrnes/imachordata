      At ESA this year, I gave a talk in a symposium about changing the culture of ecology. The talk was entitled Taking the Ecological Conversation Online and summarized what I thought were the benefits of engaging in online activities. As this was a scientific audience interested in how we might change the culture of Ecology to improve our science, I focused the talk not on what I feel are the outreach &amp; public engagement benefits of going online - those are both obvious and legion.

      ALl right - here&rsquo;s my Thursday schedule (mostly for myself so I can keep track of it on my phone). I think in the morning, I just might park myself in the session on climate change &amp; communities as one of my main interests for this meeting is&hellip;climate change and communities. Also, I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll fill in the lower right hand side of my bingo card (although I already got Bingo today on the lower line&hellip;)

      Man, this afternoon is going to be interesting. There are two sessions that I want to sit all the way through! I&rsquo;ll be speaking in the Growing Pains in Ecology session, so I&rsquo;ll be there all afternoon, but, the NutNet session looks pretty amazing as well.
OOS 33 - Growing Pains: Taking Ecology Into the 21st Century A106, Oregon Convention Center Organized by: C Strasser (carly.strasser@ucop.edu), J Tewksbury, S Hampton Moderator: C Strasser A discussion of the most important steps for ecology to take to address the complex problems set before our field by society.

      Tuesday looks to be pretty exciting. The number of overlapping talks all of which I want to see has jumped up, and, heck, there are overlapping symposia that I could sit through. That said, I THINK this is going to be my schedule&hellip;again, just posting it for myself, but feel free to browse (loading this page on ye olde smartphone and using it to navigate was wicked convenient today).
If there is one talk to see today, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s the 10:50 COS 36-9 talk by Pamela Reynolds.

      For the next few days, I&rsquo;ll be trying to focus on two areas - 1) climate change &amp; community responses and 2) biodiversity-ecosystem function - with probably a little network ecology thrown in for good measure. I&rsquo;ll be posting my schedule here not because I want you to stalk me, but rather because it will be a convenient place for me to pull up on my phone to know where I&rsquo;m going to go next!
