      So, rolling into year two here in the Biology Department at UMass Boston, I have to say I&rsquo;m having a delightful time. Fabulous colleagues (who I&rsquo;m already co-authoring papers with - that&rsquo;s just how we roll), a easy access to multiple field sites and stations, a deliciously nerdy intellectual scene throughout Boston, a brand-spankin&rsquo;-new School for the Environment, and a nice waterfront setting.
So, I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that we&rsquo;re hiring a disease ecologist/evolutionary biologist type in our department.

      I&rsquo;m so stoked that the white abalone breeding project at BML, my phdalmamater (as it were), is rocketing forward. And I&rsquo;m even more excited to see Dr. Kris Aquilino, one of my former labmates, talking about the work and communicating science LIKE A BOSS!

      Yesterday, we lost a great innovator and someone who, even if unwittingly, has really helped science. I am a passionate Mac advocate. It&rsquo;s blend of good user interface with a UNIX underpinning lets many of us just concentrate on our work rather than constantly dithering with niggling details. So, I&rsquo;m going to offer up this picture as my tribute. It&rsquo;s a pic of me back from my first field season when I was doing photo sampling in Monterey Bay and would have to download the files in between dives due to flash cards maxing out below 1gig in those days.

      I woke up this morning to a wonderful email in my inbox (thanks, Fergus!) letting me know about a little musical delight. A song about diurnal zooplankton migration entitled, well, Diurnal Migration. With lyrics like Much of the ocean is not yet explored/ Though submarines pootle about the sea floor, how can you go wrong? (Also, I now have an image of Dr. M. pootling about the seafloor).
So, I went on and decided to listen to the rest of the album, Pre-Apocalyptic Love Song, by Hannah Werdmuller, an ecologist-singer-songwriter.

      Hey, all! For the rest of the month, I&rsquo;m the Scientist in Residence over at The Deep Sea News! Muchas gracias to Rick, Miriam, Kevin, and the rest of the crew for bringing me on board. My first post is up where I discuss some of my work on How are extinctions and invasions shaping food webs?
Also, contrary to what Rick may have you believe, I&rsquo;m at NCEAS, not NESCent.

      Last October, Colin Bates and Jeff Morales conducted a workshop on Scientific Filmmaking at my old stomping grounds, the Bodega Marine Lab. The two run an awesome organization whose sole mission is to train people in ways to tell compelling science stories via video. As someone who has worked on a scientific documentary before, film is an incredible medium to have science make a direct connection with the public. So hats off to them.

      So, you&rsquo;re an ecology power-couple starting a new life. You&rsquo;ve got some elegant and incredibly ambitious experiments designed, funded, and ready to go. You&rsquo;re about to revolutionize the study of coastal ecosystems&hellip;but where?
Where is in the Gulf of Mexico.
And right before your work really takes flight, the Deepwater Horizon happens.
(add to that that one of you is taking some course from some silly guy on this thing called structural equation modeling - why would you ever do that?

      Ah, February 14th. Couples stroll arm in arm, leaning on one another, exchanging roses and kisses, eating sumptuous dinners, and losing themselves in the moment. What moment is that, you ask? Well, it&rsquo;s Squid Orgy Day!
No, really. Now is the time for squid reproduction, and in this wonderful piece on Slate by Miriam of The Oyster&rsquo;s Garter (yay! congrats on your national debut!) she lays out six secrets for those squids out there interested in making the &ldquo;beast with two beaks&rdquo;.
