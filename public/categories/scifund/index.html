      As part of the OpenPub project, we&rsquo;re soliciting folk to send us videos about their experience with the scholarly publication process. We want to use these to try and crowdfund the development of OpenPub - our preprint server with robust tools for discussion and interaction. Interested? Check out the full request over here and/or email me!

Last week, Ethan Perlstein, Erica Hermsen, and I were part of a webinar from AAAS Member Central. It was an interesting peak into what the three of us thought of this new opportunity as well as a venue for a discussion for some important issues. Check it out below!

      While I&rsquo;ve been active in using online spaces for scientific activities - blogging, tweeting, crowdfunding, and much much more - for a looong time. I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s benefitted me greatly as a scientist. I&rsquo;ve also formed a deep love for the community I&rsquo;ve found in the online science world (to name just a few).
And yet, until this year, I&rsquo;d never been to science online before.
This year, I finally remedied that.

The final version of Wheat et al.&lsquo;s paper Raising money for scientific research through crowdfunding is out in Trends in Ecology and Evolution. A more hefty piece of #SciFund analysis is behind it (slowed down in no small part because of my sloooow processing of new data in fancy models). The Wheat et al. paper is a lovely short piece that Rachel and Yiwei (who crowdfunded the excellent Alaska Predator Research Expedition that has it&rsquo;s new website over here) were gracious enough to ask Jai and I to participate in.

      So, you want to hear my vision for what #SciFund tells us about the future of science funding &amp; engagement, and back it up with data? Bam! Here you go.
This is my talk about the results from Round 1 of #SciFund from an NCEAS Ecolunch. The slides are below the video. Enjoy!

      SciFund Round 2 is now complete, and it pulled in $100,345 for science! 43% of the projects achieved 100% or more of their goal - almost double of round 1 - and 60% of all funds asked for were secured. Numerous projects that didn&rsquo;t fully reach their goal were above 80%. A TON of great research is going to come out of this, and I am excited!
Science crowdfunding continues to grow as a viable source of research fund.

      Happy Friday, everyone. To celebrate the end of the week, I leave you with what is hands down my favorite #SciFund video from round 2. And I don&rsquo;t just say this because it was made by a collaborator of mine of the #SciFund paper that we happen to be editing right this very moment (or, in half an hour or so). I say this because it is a beautiful example of the fusion of (silly) Art and Science.

      Are you excited about seeing the 125 hot science projects that got submitted to #SciFund2? Can&rsquo;t wait the additional month for those projects to post themselves online? Want to fund some awesome science right now? Maybe you signed up and want to earn some pre-#SciFund karma?
Well fear not! The Science tag on Rockethub has been taking off! A few folk were so excited about crowdfunding their work that they couldn&rsquo;t wait for #SciFund 2!

      I know, I know, I have been kinda lame about posting here lately. But that&rsquo;s because my posting muscle has been focused on the new analyses for what makes a succesful #SciFund proposal. I&rsquo;ve been posting them at the #SciFund blog under the Analysis tag - so check it out. There&rsquo;s some fun stats, and you get to watch me be a social scientist for a minute. Viva la interdisciplinarity!

      That&rsquo;s right, folk, last time we had 49 scientists bring in ~1400 people to check out their hot science and fund it to the tune of $76,000. And that was when we had no idea what we were doing. And now it&rsquo;s time for round 2! We&rsquo;re going to have a little more community review, some training, and we have a whole boatload of lessons learned.
So if you&rsquo;re a scientist who wants to crowdfund their research, go and sign up!

      After 45 days, with $76,230 raised from 1440 people, I am a pretty proud papa.
My own project hit 70% bringing in $4,600 for kelp forest research. While not complete, it funds one full round of sampling trips and a little extra, so, I&rsquo;m super excited! And now the data from RocketHub and #SciFund participants begins to flow in. Time to start doing some analyses on what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and begin to lay out the future of crowdfunding in science!

So come on over and #SciFund scientific research and help affect a revolution in how scientists interact with the world around them!

      Whew, it&rsquo;s been a bit since I posted here. Rest assured, little sea squirts, there are some interesting new things in the works. Some things that are science-y (in which I try and use this blog as a sounding board/ lab notebook) and some things not so much.
In the not so much category, a ton of my time has lately been going to the organizing of the #SciFund challenge - a large initiative to try and crowdfunding for science!
