      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s nothing so satisfying as pulling back and seeing your brand new experiment out there in the water.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy week or three getting this up and running, but now my first big postdoctoral experiment is soaking in the water, with urchins grazing away.
I&amp;rsquo;m testing some ideas regarding how diversity mediates the impact of disturbance by urchin grazing, and vice-versa - how disturbance by grazing can alter diversity.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, the devil IS in the details. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about feedbacks between community community structure and function lately, and run into a few curious roadblocks, as well as one very very interesting story.
First, the roadblocks. Just what do we mean by structure and function, particularly in reference to a biological community? Structure seems obvious - the static properties of a biological system that we can go out, stare at, and say,&amp;ldquo;Oh, yes, hello structure!</description>
