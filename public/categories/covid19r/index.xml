      <description>We want our coronavirus data! We want it now! We want it TIDY!
tl;dr Go check out the Covid19R project and it’s documentation - a way for many people to bring their unique data harvesting efforts of Covid-19 data into a single tidy data format, and then be redistributed through a single low-dependency package, covid19R. It’s all one big work-in-progress, but check it out!
