      <description>This is part of a larger series of open notebook posts about how food web structure modifies the effects of predator extinctions. For an introduction and list of other posts, see here.
OK, last but on two-level food webs for the moment. I&amp;rsquo;ve examined how food web structure can change the effects of predator or prey extinctions on both top-down and bottom-up control. A number of folk (including me) have theorized that changes in diversity at two trophic levels should interact - that the consequences of predator diversity loss should change as prey species are lost.</description>

OK, only two more entries (I think) on simple two-level food webs before we jump into the great unkown (and you&amp;rsquo;ll see how unknown it is). So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about the consequences of losing predator species for predation and energy transfer.</description>

      <description>This is part of a larger series of open notebook posts about how food web structure modifies the effects of predator extinctions. For an introduction and list of other posts, see here.
So, in my last post (notebook entry?), I introduced a new framework for understanding how the food web structure of a predator-prey food web can affect the consequences of extinction for the ability of predators to control their prey.</description>

      <description>This is part of a larger series of open notebook posts about how food web structure modifies the effects of predator extinctions. For an introduction and list of other posts, see here.
To begin tackling the question of &amp;ldquo;How does the structure of a food web influence the consequences of extinction? let&amp;rsquo;s begin by thinking about how changes in the number of predator species in a simple 2-level predator-prey food web can influence 1) the probability of prey being eaten and 2) the amount of energy transfered to the predator group.</description>

      <title>Food Web Network Structure and Extinction: The Start of an Open Notebook</title>

      <description>So, we know that species are going extinct at a pretty stunning rate. Mostly by human activities. The natural question is, will this affect the function of the natural world? You may well say &amp;lsquo;Duh! Of course!&amp;rsquo; as a first instinctive pass, but, the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t so clear cut - will species that survive simply take up the slack? What&amp;rsquo;s the value of a &amp;lsquo;species&amp;rsquo; anyway?
Starting in the late &amp;rsquo;90s the field of diversity-function research has tackled this topic, largely using manipulations plant species number.</description>
