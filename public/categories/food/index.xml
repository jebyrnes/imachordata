      <description>I love pancakes. My wife loves pancakes. My daughter LOVES chocolate pancakes (and takes a picture with her face smeared in chocolate every time she she finishes eating chocolate chip pancakes). But&amp;hellip; my daughter has celiac.
So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through a lot of GF pancake recipies, or using GF flour (Cup 4 Cup is hands down THE BEST) with regular recipes to make them. I kept being unsatisfied, but, eventually learned a basic formula to them.</description>
