      I&rsquo;m not sure what it is this year, but the kelp we&rsquo;re seeing in the Southern Gulf of Maine is just fracking huge. Last year, yeah, there were kelpy areas, and there were kelps that were ~1-1.5 meters long, which, you know, impressive. But this year&hellip;
It started when Team Dive (this summer, we have Team Marsh - #marshlife - and Team Dive going on) hit up the outer Boston Harbor Islands.

      Woohoo! It&rsquo;s another amazing research season out here at the Shoals Marine Lab. We&rsquo;re in the midst of our push to sample SML, Salem Sound, and the Boston Harbor Islands. The weather is glorious, and the water is&hellip;ok, not warm. 47F this year. Last summer at this time it was a good 5 degrees F warmer. But, either way, here we go on our summer Shoals sampling adventure!

      Last day of dives before heading back. We hit two sites on either side of the northern head of Appledore. It&rsquo;s a remarkable break, as on one side you have fairly decent expsore to waves from the West. On the other, things are fairly protected. So, there&rsquo;s a strong physical gradient. And, though perhaps just a few hundred meters apart, the two sites could not be more different. At the first site, the photos didn&rsquo;t come out terribly well, but this gives you a general sense -

      Day 2 of dives with Sarah out at SML. Today we hit two sites that were quite different - both from each other and from Norwegian Cove the other day. The Ledges are in the channel between Appledore and Smuttynose, so, they get good flow running through. This was key, as it blew sediments from the previous day&rsquo;s storm out fairly quickly. And viz was really quite nice. While it used to be a barren (at least on one side) 10 years ago, it appears that it&rsquo;s now a mix of kelps and Desmarestia with some Chondrus, filamentous reds, and others thrown in for good measure.

      The second site of the day was a surprise. 10 years ago, Smith&rsquo;s Cove was a mixed mussel bed and urchin barren. Previous, it has been a Codium meadow. Now&hellip; It&rsquo;s just a giant red algal carpet. Wall to wall. Thick, easily fragmenting, ubiquitous, invasive red Heterosiphonia japonica. Also, big tufts of Ulva. And some other bushy filamentous algae scattered about, along with a few crabs.
What a weird landscape. What is that red carpet doing?

      Well, today was it. After a 2 year hiatus behind my computer screen, my skin now softer and more delicate from its soothing rays, I hopped back in the water FOR SCIENCE! Not only that, but it was my return to dry suit diving. Oh, dry suit diving. I really didn&rsquo;t miss you and your weird buoyancy tricks (note to self, get ankle weights, as old ones have desintegrated).
It was a great day, despite feeling kinda like the first day back at school.

      So, today, I&rsquo;m going to catch a ferry out to the Shoals Marine Lab. I&rsquo;m just going to be out for a day to meet with the undergrad intern I&rsquo;m mentoring. I&rsquo;ll be back later this summer to work with her and setup some permanent monitoring transects.
I have to be honest, this is one of those moments in my life where I am watching a dream come through. I went to SML in the summer of 1999 to take some classes.

      Everyone has been pretty shocked by the devastation wreaked by Sandy. Here in New England, we also got a Nor&rsquo;easter following a few days later. That&rsquo;s a lot of intense storm action in a short period of time.
So I was quite curious as I ventured out into the field last weekend to see how things looked. I went on a potential field site scouting trip to UMB&rsquo;s field station in Nantucket.
