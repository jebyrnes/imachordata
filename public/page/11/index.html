      So, today, I&rsquo;m going to catch a ferry out to the Shoals Marine Lab. I&rsquo;m just going to be out for a day to meet with the undergrad intern I&rsquo;m mentoring. I&rsquo;ll be back later this summer to work with her and setup some permanent monitoring transects.
I have to be honest, this is one of those moments in my life where I am watching a dream come through. I went to SML in the summer of 1999 to take some classes.

      So, I recently submitted a piece regarding the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology. Simultaneous to posting, I put up a preprint in PeerJ Preprints and also put it on Google Docs for line by line commentary (which you are welcome to give!). I asked in both places that commenters identify themselves, unless they felt deeply uncomfortable.
OMG the experience has been amazing!
At PeerJ you can comment on the main page of the article, and others can rate it - which is fantastic - and I&rsquo;ve gotten some wonderful feedback there (thanks Lars!

      x-post from the OpenPub Project blog
So, we got together, had two working group meetings to discuss the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and the Earth and Ocean Sciences. What were were thinking that entire time?
We&rsquo;ve just submitted a piece that brings together our broad ideas (some of which have been seen before), but, simultaneous to publication, we&rsquo;ve also decided to put up a preprint. Why? Simply put, immediate access is one of our four pillars of the future of scholarly publication.

      So, Internet, I&rsquo;m setting up a number of monitoring sites this summer. I&rsquo;m hoping to get good wave height measurements from them to look at disturbance. I have yet to find something like the CDIP swell height model for the Gulf of Maine (although, I&rsquo;d love to hear that this is due to a failure of my google-fu). So, I&rsquo;m casting about for some good wave height sensors.
The problem I face is that I&rsquo;d like to deploy a lot of them, and in some highly variable conditions, secured to subtidal transects.

      It&rsquo;s been a mixed week, which has caused me to reflect on two beautiful posts - and put them here so that I don&rsquo;t lose them.
First, the evolution of dealing with a paper being rejected through your career.
And, naturally, the evolution of having your paper accepted throughout your career.
