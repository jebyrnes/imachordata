      Welp. It&rsquo;s been a spell. Time to bring ye olde blahg back.
As I moved talking about marine science more on to Deep Sea News, I realized that there&rsquo;s a huge part of my identity as a scientist that didn&rsquo;t work there.
Data nerdery.
As many of those posts were written in RMarkdown, I took the plunge and have remade this into a blogdown site. It&rsquo;s my first venture here. I&rsquo;m just glad I managed to port all of my old posts over!

      Note: for the most up to date version of this, see this post on rpubs
Background So, it looks like brms version 2.0 implements multivariate responses - and hence piecewise Structural Equation Modeling in a Bayesian framework. After https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/issues/303, it became clear that while one cannot do tests of D-separation, WAIC, LOO, etc., are all available. Let&rsquo;s take a peak with a familiar example.
As a note, blavaan also implements Bayesian SEM, but brms is so gorram flexible with model forms, that I think it&rsquo;s an excellent way to approach the problem that gives a lot more breathing room.

      Ensuring openness and reproducibility in ecology is an ongoing challenge, although open tools (e.g., R Studio, Github) are free to use, and user support is everywhere. To illustrate how ecology collaborations can fit within an open science framework, we had the idea of running an &lsquo;Open Derby&rsquo;. Similar to a research derby, where grad students and post-docs from different academic departments and universities collaborate together to solve a conservation problem, our idea extends the derby concept to working fully openly: learning version control in GitHub, writing and analysing data in RMarkdown, and publishing all project development in an open notebook.

      I&rsquo;ve been teaching likelihood to grad students for the past few years using the wonderful bbmle package from Ben Bolker. I really love it&rsquo;s flexibility and the way you can get students into fitting anything their imagination can countenance. But there&rsquo;s a small cost to that. First, their imagination, when they first meet likelihood, is&hellip;.not ready. I teach linear models using least squares, then likelihood, then Bayes, in order to show the full range of inferential possibilities.

      I really liked the power analysis example I gave in class today. I feel like I&rsquo;m finally firing on all cylinders with the tidyverse. So I thought I would post it here, in case it was of use to anyone!
Power OK, we can fit and evluate linear regression models, but what about their power? Let&rsquo;s look at our seal fit again - maybe we want to know what would have happened with a lower sample size?
