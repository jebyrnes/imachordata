      Well, today was it. After a 2 year hiatus behind my computer screen, my skin now softer and more delicate from its soothing rays, I hopped back in the water FOR SCIENCE! Not only that, but it was my return to dry suit diving. Oh, dry suit diving. I really didn&rsquo;t miss you and your weird buoyancy tricks (note to self, get ankle weights, as old ones have desintegrated).
It was a great day, despite feeling kinda like the first day back at school.

      Because there hasn&rsquo;t been enough ocean silliness lately&hellip;
I&rsquo;ve long been a fan of Ze Frank. But who knew that one of the next places he&rsquo;d be turning his razor sharp with was on the natural world. And not only that, but, he&rsquo;d make sure everything is pretty much scientifically kosher. So, I give you three things that nearly made me laugh so hard I was almost glad I wasn&rsquo;t in a drysuit (because tight neck seals and laughing = no fun?

      So, today, I&rsquo;m going to catch a ferry out to the Shoals Marine Lab. I&rsquo;m just going to be out for a day to meet with the undergrad intern I&rsquo;m mentoring. I&rsquo;ll be back later this summer to work with her and setup some permanent monitoring transects.
I have to be honest, this is one of those moments in my life where I am watching a dream come through. I went to SML in the summer of 1999 to take some classes.

      So, I recently submitted a piece regarding the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology. Simultaneous to posting, I put up a preprint in PeerJ Preprints and also put it on Google Docs for line by line commentary (which you are welcome to give!). I asked in both places that commenters identify themselves, unless they felt deeply uncomfortable.
OMG the experience has been amazing!
At PeerJ you can comment on the main page of the article, and others can rate it - which is fantastic - and I&rsquo;ve gotten some wonderful feedback there (thanks Lars!

      x-post from the OpenPub Project blog
So, we got together, had two working group meetings to discuss the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and the Earth and Ocean Sciences. What were were thinking that entire time?
We&rsquo;ve just submitted a piece that brings together our broad ideas (some of which have been seen before), but, simultaneous to publication, we&rsquo;ve also decided to put up a preprint. Why? Simply put, immediate access is one of our four pillars of the future of scholarly publication.
