      A question for the peanut gallery -
I&rsquo;m starting to get a trickle of the interested-in-grad-school student emails. So far the few I&rsquo;ve gotten have been great. So, I&rsquo;m revising my prospective students page after noticing a few things in year one. The first was a lack of some students realizing that I wanted to know their interests beyond &lsquo;marine ecology&rsquo;. I wanted a research question - any question, no matter how broad - as having a question does not guarantee it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to follow in your graduate career.

      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure you aren&rsquo;t wondering, how did that creating &lsquo;ecospecies&rsquo; from bacterial sequences based on sequence similarity, co-occurrence, and network theory work out for you?&rdquo;
Quite well, thanks for asking! Heck, have a git repository, why dontcha!
Jen is furiously writing the manuscript, but, the technique indeed seems to indicate that 12% sequence similarity was the optimal number.
Once we got that down, and started plotting the network with individual Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) each connected to one or more of the 8 plots they were found in, we started seeing some neat things.

      One of the great things about field stations is the silliness they engender. I mean, there you are, in the middle of nowhere, with no one but other scientists thinking about the wonder of the natural world. Awe and wonder can only take you so far. And then, at some point, you cross over, and start to get a little silly.
It leads to things like dressing up as fouling panels, launching serious plans to make an &lsquo;underwater office,&rsquo; elaborate nail-polish-marking designs for crab carapaces, and no small number of pranks.

      x-posted from openpub
One year ago, one of the more intereting experiments in open access publishing - PeerJ - launched. It&rsquo;s model of membership rather than paying by the article is still something people are grappling with - it&rsquo;s just so different, so delightfully disruptive. Not only that, but PeerJ has stepped in to fill the void in providing a biology preprint server (which we have used), as well as coming up with a more intuitive interface for commentary on preprints and published work - along with supplying reviews alongside published work.

      Last day of dives before heading back. We hit two sites on either side of the northern head of Appledore. It&rsquo;s a remarkable break, as on one side you have fairly decent expsore to waves from the West. On the other, things are fairly protected. So, there&rsquo;s a strong physical gradient. And, though perhaps just a few hundred meters apart, the two sites could not be more different. At the first site, the photos didn&rsquo;t come out terribly well, but this gives you a general sense -
