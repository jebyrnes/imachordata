            <p>I&rsquo;m not sure what it is this year, but the kelp we&rsquo;re seeing in the Southern Gulf of Maine is just fracking huge. Last year, yeah, there were kelpy areas, and there were kelps that were ~1-1.5 meters long, which, you know, impressive. But this year&hellip;</p>
<p>It started when Team Dive (this summer, we have Team Marsh - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23marshlife&amp;src=typd">#marshlife</a> -  and Team Dive going on) hit up the outer Boston Harbor Islands. We hadn&rsquo;t been out much since winter. They found vasty fields of <em>Laminaria digitata</em> and <em>Saccharina latissima</em> (well, with their super-long stipes, they looked like <em>S. longicruris</em>, but it looks like they are now the same species - e.g., Cho et al. 2000 and others). How big? Twice the size of a grad student!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14281816117_10bcbb8626_k-1024x768.jpg" alt="14281816117_10bcbb8626_k"></p>
<p>But this was at the mouth of Boston Harbor. Maybe a fluke, or eutrophication?</p>
<p>As we kept working up in Salem Sound, though, the kelp seemed&hellip;well&hellip;big! But, eh, still urban-ish, still maybe an urban thing&hellip; (although it was <em>not</em> so big last summer).</p>
<p>If anywhere should be free of the urban influence, it should be Appledore Island in the Isles of Shoals. It&rsquo;s a few miles offshore, and has lots of microenvironments. And yet, everywhere we look - big-arse kelp! Super dense kelp area where last year an intern almost lost her mind counting kelp stipes? Still mind-exploding. Except now you have to count stipes by feel while your face gets wrapped up in the giant lasagna-blades of <em>Saccharina</em>. And it&rsquo;s just as big.</p>
<p>OK, I&rsquo;m 6'2&rdquo;.  And a half. (~1.88m).  Here&rsquo;s me, with my fins just barely touching the seafloor.
<img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14501269767_ec57bf9bdf_k-768x1024.jpg" alt="14501269767_ec57bf9bdf_k"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s everywhere! Even in the wave-protected low-kelp density <em>Heterosiphonia</em> sites, while we do find lots of smaller kelps, the monsters still abound. See how it compares to the size of Team Dive.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14714982553_7fe4126bbb_k-1024x768.jpg" alt="14714982553_7fe4126bbb_k"></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say it&rsquo;s <em>all</em> that huge.  A size distribution from the site that piece came from for reference:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.imachordata.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14508450178_38a07a7ff0_k-1024x768.jpg" alt="14508450178_38a07a7ff0_k"></p>
<p>But, still, what is up with this? Big kelps coupled with very cold water temperatures of course has my California trained brain thinking more time with high nutrients, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that relationship is as strong here in the southern Gulf of Maine. It&rsquo;s making me very excited to see the oceanographic work that comes out in the next year or so to see just what forces are driving all of this!</p>
<p>And even more curious to know what&rsquo;s going to happen next year, as we&rsquo;re seeing massive numbers of tiny urchin recruits (and a lot of sea star recruits) often folded up in the eroding tips of many of these big honkers. Or on <em>Desmerestia</em>, like ornaments on a Christmas tree (240 in a square meter plot yesterday!).</p>
