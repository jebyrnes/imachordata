            <p>So, you&rsquo;re graduating with a biology or environmental science or marine bio degree!  Hurray!  You&rsquo;ve finished your stint at college, and you&rsquo;ve gained a lot of new skills.  Maybe you&rsquo;ve done some time in research, maybe not (!!!), but now that you&rsquo;ve wrapped up, you want to find a job in the environmental sciences.  Something that will give you research experience, and help you on your way to either a career or deciding whether you want to go into research.</p>
<p>OK, where do you go now?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest.  For me, this was easy.  I was lucky enough to have had experiences (and <a href="http://deepseanews.com/2013/01/a-field-guide-to-privilege-in-marine-science-some-reasons-why-we-lack-diversity/">more</a> to be honest) that channeled me into a top-notch research lab as an undergrad, which opened up further opportunities for an REU program at SML. The one-two punch of a great mentor and a great REU experience gave me a publication under my belt, and let me know, yes, this is what I want to do with my life.  So I docked around for a year as a tech in different places, but I knew I was grad-school bound.</p>
<p>This is not always the case.  I&rsquo;m teaching a Marine Biology &amp; Ecology course this year and my students, all seniors, vary greatly in background. For some, this is their first time taking marine bio or anything related, as we haven&rsquo;t traditionally had a lot of regular offerings in the past. Others have done a lot of environmental science work, but don&rsquo;t have much field experience on research projects.</p>
<p>But now they&rsquo;re fired up. And they&rsquo;re great students. And they want to know what to do next. Because they&rsquo;re graduating.</p>
<p>Or I was recently approached by a friend who finished her undergrad years ago, and has been working in advertising (kinda sorta). But she&rsquo;s been taking marine bio and other courses on the sly.  And now wants to find a position that will give her a leg up and a last piece of experience to determine where to go next in her career path involving science.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s tremendously talented. Motivated. And doesn&rsquo;t quite know where to turn next.</p>
<p>I have a few ideas on the topic, but, I tweeted out a query on the topic, and got far more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, without further ado, here&rsquo;s the list of places to look when interested in a job just out of undergrad for more experience in ecology &amp; environmental sciences.  This list is by no means comprehensive, and if you have any suggestions, <em>let me know</em>.  I plan to incorporate this onto my lab website as a resource in the near future.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sign up for the Ecological Society of America&rsquo;s <a href="https://listserv.umd.edu/archives/ecolog-l.html">mailing list</a>.  Lots of opportunities flow through there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ESA <a href="http://biology.duke.edu/jackson/ecophys/positions.html">Phys Ecology job board</a> has a ton of jobs, and for far more than just physiological ecology work.  Check out their staff and seasonal positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same group also provides a great <a href="http://biology.duke.edu/jackson/ecophys/joblinks.html">list of job boards</a> worth checking out. Start there, and go down the rabbit hole of the wide array of positions available, although some are for more senior folk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birder? Check out the extensive listing at the <a href="http://www.osnabirds.org/jobs.aspx">Ornithological societies of North America job page</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To start to get into government research, see the <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/ohr/">USGS jobs page</a>.  Many of the listings are for research internships as well as government positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Texas A&amp;M; Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences provides a wonderful <a href="http://wfscjobs.tamu.edu/job-board/">job and internship listing</a> for positions around the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way to get into field work is to, well, work at a field station! The Organization of Biological Field Stations provides a <a href="http://www.obfs.org/news">listing of current positions</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way many recent grads get involved in more management and conservation is with jobs and internships at the <a href="http://www.thesca.org/about/current-openings">Student Conservation Association</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography maintains a <a href="http://aslo.org/employment/jobs.html">job board</a> that is a mix of tech-level positions and upper level positions. So, some filtering required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Environmental Career Opportunities posts a wide <a href="http://www.ecojobs.com/index.php">variety of job types</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the more geography inclined, see <a href="http://www.scgis.org/Lev3Page.aspx?Page3ID=20">The Society for Conservation GIS</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in education, museums, and wildlife, the <a href="http://www.aza.org/JobListings/">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> has a wide variety of opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And last, for a ton of additional information for postgrad and beyond, <a href="http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/links/academia.html">Marissa Baskett</a> maintains a superb website.  It&rsquo;s a bit beyond the scope of what we&rsquo;re talking about here, and just academia focused, but it provides a great jumping off point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
