            <p>Well, today was it.  After a 2 year hiatus behind my computer screen, my skin now softer and more delicate from its soothing rays, I hopped back in the water FOR SCIENCE!

<p>It was a great day, despite feeling kinda like the first day back at school.  Ted (lab manager) and I came out to SML to work with a fantastic undergrad I&rsquo;m advising for the summer, as well as do some site scouting of our own.  The weather report said that things would turn awful in the afternoon/early evening (and was right), so, a morning dive on the backside of Appledore was just the thing.</p>

<p>We were there to help Sarah census the invasive <a href="http://seaweeds.uib.no/?art=769"><em>Heterosiphonia japonica</em></a> to look at its distribution with respect to a depth and exposure gradient (see also this kick butt paper by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062261">Christine Newton et al.</a>).  And the backside of Appledore is <em>quite</em> exposed.  The transects we were sampling are next to a spot in the intertidal that got wiped bare by this winter&rsquo;s storms.</p>

<p>What intrigued me about the transects was two things.  I remember this area being super-kelpy.  Indeed, the wave exposure limited <em>Codium</em> back when that alga was the big bad (I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s quite rare here, and in a quick checkout at The Cribs, I only saw 3 individuals).  But now&hellip;well, there are some kelps, but, mostly, it&rsquo;s red and brown filamentous algae.  A lot of <em>Desmerestia viridis</em> to be sure, but a lot of red and brown puffiness.  That, and a lot more <em>Chondrus</em>.  I mean, we were fairly shallow, but, still.  Interesting.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Not a lot of <em>Heterosiphonia</em>, though.  It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see how Sarah&rsquo;s project turns out.  Some sites have been heavy with it, some light.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just glad to be back in, and seeing how the place has changed.  Steneck&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/2013/00000089/00000001/art00004">Flips &amp; Locks</a> paper was an interesting update on how this system is doing. I&rsquo;m going to be curious to browse around and try and take the big whole community perspective I honed at the SBC LTER and see what there is to see here.</p>
