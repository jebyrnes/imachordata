<p>Jen is furiously writing the manuscript, but, the <a href="http://www.imachordata.com/more-on-bacteria-and-groups/">technique</a> indeed seems to indicate that 12% sequence similarity was the optimal number.</p>
<p>Once we got that down, and started plotting the network with individual Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) each connected to one or more of the 8 plots they were found in, we started seeing some neat things.  More more than that, they were just pretty pictures!  I mean, come on, these plots are always cool.</p>

<p>First, you can see that there is indeed some separation of species by plot and treatment (# is plot, letter is treatment).  We got really excited about this, and so dug deeper to produce&hellip;</p>

<p>Yes.  Not you can see that most OTUs are specialists.  True generalists are exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>We had one other piece of information up our sleeve, though.  Abundance.  We have abundances of OTUs.  Playing around with edge widths (abundance in plot) didn&rsquo;t produce anything striking.  But then we looked at total abundance of an OTU across the whole marsh, and resized OTU nodes accordingly.  I think this is exceedingly beautiful.  And shows some striking patterns with respect to treatment and who is most abundant.</p>

<p>Jen knows this experiment backwards and forwards, so is writing a much more nuanced discussion of what this means, and analyzing the data in more detail.  But it&rsquo;s pretty awesome.  And pretty beautiful.</p>
<p>Just another way of viewing the wonder of nature.</p>
