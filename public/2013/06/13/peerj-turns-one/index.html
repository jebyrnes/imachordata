<p><a href="http://blog.peerj.com/post/52783384704/celebrating-the-one-year-anniversary-of-peerj">One year ago</a>, one of the more intereting experiments in open access publishing - <a href="http://www.peerj.com">PeerJ</a> - launched.  It&rsquo;s <a href="https://peerj.com/pricing/">model of membership</a> rather than paying by the article is still something people are grappling with - it&rsquo;s just so different, so delightfully disruptive.  Not only that, but PeerJ has stepped in to fill the void in providing a <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/">biology preprint server</a> (which <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/11">we have used</a>), as well as coming up with a more intuitive interface for commentary on preprints and published work - along with supplying reviews alongside published work.  A number of other great open access journals have tried one or more of these innovations, but few have tried them all <em>at once</em>.  Not only that, but I have the feeling they&rsquo;re not going to stop there.</p>
<p>After all, if they&rsquo;ve tried this many new things in year one, I, for one, want to know what year two is going to hold&hellip;</p>
