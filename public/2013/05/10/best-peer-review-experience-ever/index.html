OMG the experience has been amazing!
At PeerJ you can comment on the main page of the article, and others can rate it - which is fantastic - and I&rsquo;ve gotten some wonderful feedback there (thanks Lars!" />

            <p>So, I recently submitted a piece regarding the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology.  Simultaneous to posting, I <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/11/">put up a preprint in PeerJ Preprints</a> and also put it on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ac0tX-i6zELc75ij8Voyg5Rj4AQYEtGvpAiYcGcql_I/edit?usp=sharing">Google Docs for line by line commentary</a> (which you are welcome to give!).

<p>The Google Doc experience has been even more fascinating, given the ability to put in line by line comments.</p>
<p>One of our reviewers is using the Google Doc for their comments.  It has made it easy to see what they are saying, respond to things that I think are relevant (or I&rsquo;ll just change some of the text in the next draft for bigger changes), and have an interactive experience with the reviewer.  It absolutely fabulous.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really fascinated by the idea of how collaboration can improve peer review ever since reading Leek et al.&lsquo;s 2011 piece <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026895">Cooperation between Referees and Authors Increases Peer Review Accuracy</a>. I&rsquo;m delighted that one of our reviewers has embraced that ethos, and in so doing, I can see how this will really help with future publications if not just <a href="http://rossmounce.co.uk/">Ross Mounce</a>, but everyone embraced this model.  Very cool!</p>
