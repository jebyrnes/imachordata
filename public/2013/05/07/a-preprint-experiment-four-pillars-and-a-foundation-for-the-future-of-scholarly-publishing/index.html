<p>So, we got together, had two working group meetings to discuss the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and the Earth and Ocean Sciences.  What were were thinking that entire time?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just submitted a piece that brings together our broad ideas (some of which have been seen before), but, simultaneous to publication, we&rsquo;ve also decided to put up a preprint.  Why?  Simply put, <strong>immediate access</strong> is one of our four pillars of the future of scholarly publication.  Once you feel something is ready for public consumption, put it out there!  We&rsquo;ve been delighted to watch the evolution of <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/">PeerJ Preprints</a>, so we&rsquo;ve placed our piece there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This immediate access to the piece goes hand in hand with another of our four pillars.  <strong>Open Review</strong>.  We want to know what you think.  And now.  We hope you give us feedback over <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.11">at the preprint</a>.  Or, if you want to give us more detailed annotated comment, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ac0tX-i6zELc75ij8Voyg5Rj4AQYEtGvpAiYcGcql_I/edit?usp=sharing">we&rsquo;ve put it in a comment-open Google doc</a>.  Highlight something you disagree with.  Argue with us.  We welcome it!  We&rsquo;d ask that you put your name with the comment.  We want a discussion, as discussion will improve this manuscript and help us shape our argument rather than just one-way commenting. This will also allow <em>you</em> to get <strong>full recognition</strong> for your comments, and we will include this in future acknowledgements.</p>
<p>So, enjoy the piece - our commentary is not a straight experiment-analysis-discussion piece, but rather part of a broader <strong>ecosystem of scholarly products</strong> that we feel are important to get out there.  We look forward to hearing <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/11/">what you think of the piece!</a></p>
