      As part of the Covid19R Project, I’ve been working on a new package, covid19mobility. It started as an effort to pull in the Apple Mobility Trends, and has since morphed as more mobility data comes out. Right now, I’m working through the Google Mobility Data, &amp; I’m interested in the Descartes mobility data and any others you can suggest down below (link to source)! But the data itself - it’s FASCINATING!

      I love pancakes. My wife loves pancakes. My daughter LOVES chocolate pancakes (and takes a picture with her face smeared in chocolate every time she she finishes eating chocolate chip pancakes). But&hellip; my daughter has celiac.
So, I&rsquo;ve been working through a lot of GF pancake recipies, or using GF flour (Cup 4 Cup is hands down THE BEST) with regular recipes to make them. I kept being unsatisfied, but, eventually learned a basic formula to them.

      We want our coronavirus data! We want it now! We want it TIDY!
tl;dr Go check out the Covid19R project and it’s documentation - a way for many people to bring their unique data harvesting efforts of Covid-19 data into a single tidy data format, and then be redistributed through a single low-dependency package, covid19R. It’s all one big work-in-progress, but check it out!
OK, the story! Back in February (remember February), while teaching data science, I was trying to think of ways to spice up the class with more relevant data.

      Welp. It&rsquo;s been a spell. Time to bring ye olde blahg back.
As I moved talking about marine science more on to Deep Sea News, I realized that there&rsquo;s a huge part of my identity as a scientist that didn&rsquo;t work there.
Data nerdery.
As many of those posts were written in RMarkdown, I took the plunge and have remade this into a blogdown site. It&rsquo;s my first venture here. I&rsquo;m just glad I managed to port all of my old posts over!

      Note: for the most up to date version of this, see this post on rpubs
Background So, it looks like brms version 2.0 implements multivariate responses - and hence piecewise Structural Equation Modeling in a Bayesian framework. After https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/issues/303, it became clear that while one cannot do tests of D-separation, WAIC, LOO, etc., are all available. Let&rsquo;s take a peak with a familiar example.
As a note, blavaan also implements Bayesian SEM, but brms is so gorram flexible with model forms, that I think it&rsquo;s an excellent way to approach the problem that gives a lot more breathing room.

      Ensuring openness and reproducibility in ecology is an ongoing challenge, although open tools (e.g., R Studio, Github) are free to use, and user support is everywhere. To illustrate how ecology collaborations can fit within an open science framework, we had the idea of running an &lsquo;Open Derby&rsquo;. Similar to a research derby, where grad students and post-docs from different academic departments and universities collaborate together to solve a conservation problem, our idea extends the derby concept to working fully openly: learning version control in GitHub, writing and analysing data in RMarkdown, and publishing all project development in an open notebook.

      I&rsquo;ve been teaching likelihood to grad students for the past few years using the wonderful bbmle package from Ben Bolker. I really love it&rsquo;s flexibility and the way you can get students into fitting anything their imagination can countenance. But there&rsquo;s a small cost to that. First, their imagination, when they first meet likelihood, is&hellip;.not ready. I teach linear models using least squares, then likelihood, then Bayes, in order to show the full range of inferential possibilities.

      I really liked the power analysis example I gave in class today. I feel like I&rsquo;m finally firing on all cylinders with the tidyverse. So I thought I would post it here, in case it was of use to anyone!
Power OK, we can fit and evluate linear regression models, but what about their power? Let&rsquo;s look at our seal fit again - maybe we want to know what would have happened with a lower sample size?

      There&rsquo;s a feature that is either new or I haven&rsquo;t noticed before in the new release of tidyr that is making me giddy with giddiness. The complete function.
This seems odd. Why would just one function make you giddy, Jarrett? Why not all of them?
It&rsquo;s making me so happy as it solves a problem that just took a substantial degree of thought and waaaay to many lines of code to solve in a massive meta-analysis of kelp abundances I&rsquo;m working on with colleagues.

      OK, so, I spoke too soon. There are at least a few stabs by scientists writing about being a parent who studies climate/environmental change. As folk send me more, I&rsquo;ll try and keep this list updated. While there&rsquo;s some great stuff here, I feel like this is an empty niche for some great writing. Maybe you want to contribute, too? Towards that end, anyone who has a yen, I will be happy to post, repost, or link your own writings here under my science parent category.

      An old friend with a new child asked me if I know any climate change scientists or global change biologists who are parents and have written cogently about being parents in the era of climate change. Off of the top of my head, I couldn&rsquo;t think of any (prove me wrong, internet), but, heck, I&rsquo;m one myself. Here I am, staring down the barrel of hitting one year since HD&rsquo;s arrival.

      How to process something like Rafe Sagarin&rsquo;s senseless passing? For those who never encountered him, Rafe was a wonderful marine ecologist whose body of work was as varied and eclectic as can be, from classic papers on long-term effects of climate change in Science and Ecological Monograph to books on how the natural world can help us deal with risk, like terrorist attacks, to working at Biosphere2. He&rsquo;s even got a wonderful youtube channel that works, as he always did, outside of the box.

      Who wants to make a kickass, public-friendly, dynamic, online appendix with a map for their papers? ME! (and you, right?) Let&rsquo;s talk about a cool way to make your data sing to a much broader audience than a static image.
Last time, I mentioned that I had also been playing the Rstudio&rsquo;s Leaflet package. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Leaflet is a javascript library for generating interactive maps. I don&rsquo;t know javascript (really), but I do know R, so this library is incredibly powerful for someone like me - particularly when paired with Rstudio&rsquo;s HTMLwidgets or Shiny for publishing things.

So, what&rsquo;s a guy on leave to do?

      Positive Multifunctionality ≠ All Functions Are Positive
I was dismayed this morning to read Bradford et al.&lsquo;s recently accepted paper Discontinuity in the responses of ecosystem processes and multifunctionality to altered soil community composition in PNAS for several reasons.
The paper itself is really cool. They manipulated community complexity and nutrient conditions in the Ecotron, and then looked at five soil ecosystem functions. They then looked at whether complexity influenced multi functionality (as well as N), and found, indeed, it did!

      Sometimes, you have to publish a paper to have the hit-yourself-in-the-head revelation of the real right answer.
Earlier this year, along with a great cohort of colleagues, I birthed a really neat piece summarizing how you can look at simultaneous change in multiple ecosystem functions. We were interested in how changes in diversity can affect the simultaneous performance of multiple functions, but, really, anything can be put on the X axis - warming, fertilization, lemony-fresh-scentedness - it doesn&rsquo;t matter.

      This is x-posted from my guest post at Deep Sea News about the new Floating Forests citizen science project I&rsquo;m part of. If you&rsquo;re excited about it, go check out http://www.floatingforests.org/!
There&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always wanted. Something that would take kelp forest science to a new level. Something that would let me do the kind of work that I dream about, quietly, secretly, peering into the mysteries of kelpiness.
It is something impossible.

      For a blog post somewhere else, I&rsquo;m trying to re-work the Beatle&rsquo;s classic Kelp!, er, I mean, Help!. But my first draft got all urchin-y. I love it, though, so I thought I&rsquo;d post it here.
KELP! (from the perspective of a growing urchin)
Kelp! I need some algae. Kelp! not just any algae Kelp! You know I need some kelp!
When I was younger (So much younger than) so much younger than today (I never needed) I never needed any growing kelp in any way (Now) But now these days are gone (These days are gone), I don&rsquo;t eat just diatoms (I know I&rsquo;ve found) Now I find I&rsquo;ve changed my mind and opened up my jaws

      I&rsquo;m not sure what it is this year, but the kelp we&rsquo;re seeing in the Southern Gulf of Maine is just fracking huge. Last year, yeah, there were kelpy areas, and there were kelps that were ~1-1.5 meters long, which, you know, impressive. But this year&hellip;
It started when Team Dive (this summer, we have Team Marsh - #marshlife - and Team Dive going on) hit up the outer Boston Harbor Islands.

      Woohoo! It&rsquo;s another amazing research season out here at the Shoals Marine Lab. We&rsquo;re in the midst of our push to sample SML, Salem Sound, and the Boston Harbor Islands. The weather is glorious, and the water is&hellip;ok, not warm. 47F this year. Last summer at this time it was a good 5 degrees F warmer. But, either way, here we go on our summer Shoals sampling adventure!

      So, you&rsquo;re graduating with a biology or environmental science or marine bio degree! Hurray! You&rsquo;ve finished your stint at college, and you&rsquo;ve gained a lot of new skills. Maybe you&rsquo;ve done some time in research, maybe not (!!!), but now that you&rsquo;ve wrapped up, you want to find a job in the environmental sciences. Something that will give you research experience, and help you on your way to either a career or deciding whether you want to go into research.

      I&rsquo;ve ended up digging into quantile regression a bit lately (see this excellent gentle introduction to quantile regression for ecologists [pdf] for what it is and some great reasons why to use it -see also here and here). In R this is done via the quantreg package, which is pretty nice, and has some great plotting diagnostics, etc. But what it doesn&rsquo;t have out of the box is a way to simply plot your data, and then overlay quantile regression lines at different levels of tau.

But today my postdoc Alison introduced me to Dancing Statistics. And it is lovely.
In short, this troupe of dancers illustrates a wide variety of statistical concepts using naught but movement.
Now I just can&rsquo;t wait until they get to p-values and Bayes&rsquo; theorem.

      So, rolling into year two here in the Biology Department at UMass Boston, I have to say I&rsquo;m having a delightful time. Fabulous colleagues (who I&rsquo;m already co-authoring papers with - that&rsquo;s just how we roll), a easy access to multiple field sites and stations, a deliciously nerdy intellectual scene throughout Boston, a brand-spankin&rsquo;-new School for the Environment, and a nice waterfront setting.
So, I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that we&rsquo;re hiring a disease ecologist/evolutionary biologist type in our department.

      It is cocktail week over at Deep Sea News. And it has been glorious, with marine biology themed cocktails galore. As a cocktilian myself, I felt that I had to kick in, well, a real classic. I classic that, I daresay, may lay at the root of kelp forest ecology itself. And yet may be under threat.
&ldquo;Wait, what?&rdquo; I hear you saying. Let me explain.
Kelps are incredible. I mean, this is a clade of algae with members who can grow a foot per day, that form giant forests that rival the redwoods in beauty, that embrace diversity looking like everything from a mini-palm-tree to a majestic pair of antlers 60 feet high, to a lasagna noodle.

      _A bit of context first. This letter arose as a result of discussions regarding citations practices in meta-analyses on Twitter several weeks ago. We all agreed citations of work within meta-analyses should be counted, but noted that many modern citation counting services disregard any citations not in the main body of a paper. Appendix citations are dropped, however. And due to a variety of restrictions, we often only cite the papers we use as data in appendices, and so are not counted.

      OK, so, you&rsquo;re a scientist interested in jumping into the world of online social networking for interacting with colleagues, fun and profitbringing science to the world at large. Fantastic!
So, you log on, and are suddenly confronted by a dizzying array of sites you could use to communicate. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Myspace (yes, it&rsquo;s back), Blogspot, Wordpress, FriendFeed, Tumblr, &hellip;. I could go on for a while. And then you may also have concerns about mixing personal and private.

      While working more on the bacterial network stuff, Jen and I realized I was wrong. Yep, I was wrong on the internet. Namely, in my post on bacterial networks, I got the answer wrong on the abundance of OTUs with different degrees of specialization. I had a rowSum after inverting a matrix instead of before, producing wonky vertex sizes. Jen cleverly discovered it when totaling up some of the data by hand, and after alerting me to the issue I produced the following plot which doesn&rsquo;t agree with the network at all:

      A question for the peanut gallery -
I&rsquo;m starting to get a trickle of the interested-in-grad-school student emails. So far the few I&rsquo;ve gotten have been great. So, I&rsquo;m revising my prospective students page after noticing a few things in year one. The first was a lack of some students realizing that I wanted to know their interests beyond &lsquo;marine ecology&rsquo;. I wanted a research question - any question, no matter how broad - as having a question does not guarantee it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to follow in your graduate career.

      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure you aren&rsquo;t wondering, how did that creating &lsquo;ecospecies&rsquo; from bacterial sequences based on sequence similarity, co-occurrence, and network theory work out for you?&rdquo;
Quite well, thanks for asking! Heck, have a git repository, why dontcha!
Jen is furiously writing the manuscript, but, the technique indeed seems to indicate that 12% sequence similarity was the optimal number.
Once we got that down, and started plotting the network with individual Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) each connected to one or more of the 8 plots they were found in, we started seeing some neat things.

      One of the great things about field stations is the silliness they engender. I mean, there you are, in the middle of nowhere, with no one but other scientists thinking about the wonder of the natural world. Awe and wonder can only take you so far. And then, at some point, you cross over, and start to get a little silly.
It leads to things like dressing up as fouling panels, launching serious plans to make an &lsquo;underwater office,&rsquo; elaborate nail-polish-marking designs for crab carapaces, and no small number of pranks.

One year ago, one of the more intereting experiments in open access publishing - PeerJ - launched. It&rsquo;s model of membership rather than paying by the article is still something people are grappling with - it&rsquo;s just so different, so delightfully disruptive. Not only that, but PeerJ has stepped in to fill the void in providing a biology preprint server (which we have used), as well as coming up with a more intuitive interface for commentary on preprints and published work - along with supplying reviews alongside published work.

      Last day of dives before heading back. We hit two sites on either side of the northern head of Appledore. It&rsquo;s a remarkable break, as on one side you have fairly decent expsore to waves from the West. On the other, things are fairly protected. So, there&rsquo;s a strong physical gradient. And, though perhaps just a few hundred meters apart, the two sites could not be more different. At the first site, the photos didn&rsquo;t come out terribly well, but this gives you a general sense -

      Day 2 of dives with Sarah out at SML. Today we hit two sites that were quite different - both from each other and from Norwegian Cove the other day. The Ledges are in the channel between Appledore and Smuttynose, so, they get good flow running through. This was key, as it blew sediments from the previous day&rsquo;s storm out fairly quickly. And viz was really quite nice. While it used to be a barren (at least on one side) 10 years ago, it appears that it&rsquo;s now a mix of kelps and Desmarestia with some Chondrus, filamentous reds, and others thrown in for good measure.

      The second site of the day was a surprise. 10 years ago, Smith&rsquo;s Cove was a mixed mussel bed and urchin barren. Previous, it has been a Codium meadow. Now&hellip; It&rsquo;s just a giant red algal carpet. Wall to wall. Thick, easily fragmenting, ubiquitous, invasive red Heterosiphonia japonica. Also, big tufts of Ulva. And some other bushy filamentous algae scattered about, along with a few crabs.
What a weird landscape. What is that red carpet doing?

      Well, today was it. After a 2 year hiatus behind my computer screen, my skin now softer and more delicate from its soothing rays, I hopped back in the water FOR SCIENCE! Not only that, but it was my return to dry suit diving. Oh, dry suit diving. I really didn&rsquo;t miss you and your weird buoyancy tricks (note to self, get ankle weights, as old ones have desintegrated).
It was a great day, despite feeling kinda like the first day back at school.

And not only that, but, he&rsquo;d make sure everything is pretty much scientifically kosher.

      So, today, I&rsquo;m going to catch a ferry out to the Shoals Marine Lab. I&rsquo;m just going to be out for a day to meet with the undergrad intern I&rsquo;m mentoring. I&rsquo;ll be back later this summer to work with her and setup some permanent monitoring transects.
I have to be honest, this is one of those moments in my life where I am watching a dream come through. I went to SML in the summer of 1999 to take some classes.

      So, I recently submitted a piece regarding the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology. Simultaneous to posting, I put up a preprint in PeerJ Preprints and also put it on Google Docs for line by line commentary (which you are welcome to give!). I asked in both places that commenters identify themselves, unless they felt deeply uncomfortable.
OMG the experience has been amazing!
At PeerJ you can comment on the main page of the article, and others can rate it - which is fantastic - and I&rsquo;ve gotten some wonderful feedback there (thanks Lars!

So, we got together, had two working group meetings to discuss the future of scholarly publishing in Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, and the Earth and Ocean Sciences. What were were thinking that entire time?
We&rsquo;ve just submitted a piece that brings together our broad ideas (some of which have been seen before), but, simultaneous to publication, we&rsquo;ve also decided to put up a preprint. Why? Simply put, immediate access is one of our four pillars of the future of scholarly publication.

      So, Internet, I&rsquo;m setting up a number of monitoring sites this summer. I&rsquo;m hoping to get good wave height measurements from them to look at disturbance. I have yet to find something like the CDIP swell height model for the Gulf of Maine (although, I&rsquo;d love to hear that this is due to a failure of my google-fu). So, I&rsquo;m casting about for some good wave height sensors.
The problem I face is that I&rsquo;d like to deploy a lot of them, and in some highly variable conditions, secured to subtidal transects.

These next two years I&rsquo;m getting a program up and running looking at kelp forests, climate change, and food web structure around New England. But I want someone who comes in with some interesting ideas and plans.

      Let&rsquo;s say you want to extract a p-value and save it as a variable for future use from a linear or generalized linear model - mixed or non! This is something you might want to do if, say, you were calculating Fisher&rsquo;s C from an equation-level Structural Equation Model. Here&rsquo;s how to extract the effect of a variable from multiple different fit models. We&rsquo;ll start with a data set with x, y, z, and a block effect (we&rsquo;ll see who in a moment).

      Sometimes in an SEM for which you&rsquo;re calculating a test of D-Separation, you want all exogenous variables to covary. If you have a large model with a number of exogenous variables, coding that into your basis set can be a pain, and hence, you can spend a lot of time filtering out elements that aren&rsquo;t part of your basis set, particularly with the ggm library. Here&rsquo;s a solution - a function I&rsquo;m calling filterExoFromBasiSet

Last week, Ethan Perlstein, Erica Hermsen, and I were part of a webinar from AAAS Member Central. It was an interesting peak into what the three of us thought of this new opportunity as well as a venue for a discussion for some important issues. Check it out below!

      While I&rsquo;ve been active in using online spaces for scientific activities - blogging, tweeting, crowdfunding, and much much more - for a looong time. I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s benefitted me greatly as a scientist. I&rsquo;ve also formed a deep love for the community I&rsquo;ve found in the online science world (to name just a few).
And yet, until this year, I&rsquo;d never been to science online before.
This year, I finally remedied that.

The final version of Wheat et al.&lsquo;s paper Raising money for scientific research through crowdfunding is out in Trends in Ecology and Evolution. A more hefty piece of #SciFund analysis is behind it (slowed down in no small part because of my sloooow processing of new data in fancy models). The Wheat et al. paper is a lovely short piece that Rachel and Yiwei (who crowdfunded the excellent Alaska Predator Research Expedition that has it&rsquo;s new website over here) were gracious enough to ask Jai and I to participate in.

      As someone who, admittedly, benefitted a great deal from Privilege growing up (it definitely lowered the barriers to my becoming a succesful marine scientist), know that this is true of MANY Ecology and Evolutionary Biology folk, and now think a good deal about how I can lower those barriers for students and mentees that come under my aegis, you should all go over and check out Miriam Goldstein&rsquo;s A field guide to privilege in marine science: some reasons why we lack diversity.

      I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of meta-analytic things lately. More on that anon. But one quick thing that came up was variance weighting with mixed models in R, and after a few web searches, I wanted to post this, more as a note-to-self and others than anything. Now, in a simple linear model, weighting by variance or sample size is straightforward.
#variance lm(y ~ x, data = dat, weights = 1/v) #sample size lm(y ~ x, data = dat, weights = n) You can use the same sort of weights argument with lmer.

      Everyone has been pretty shocked by the devastation wreaked by Sandy. Here in New England, we also got a Nor&rsquo;easter following a few days later. That&rsquo;s a lot of intense storm action in a short period of time.
So I was quite curious as I ventured out into the field last weekend to see how things looked. I went on a potential field site scouting trip to UMB&rsquo;s field station in Nantucket.

      _This is a x-post from the blog I&rsquo;ve setup for my course blog. As my first class at UMB, I&rsquo;m teaching An Introduction to Computational Data Analysis for Biology - basically mixing teaching statistics and basic programming. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve thought a long time about teaching - although the rubber meeting the road has been fascinating.
As part of the course, I&rsquo;m adapting an exercise that I learned while taking English courses - in particular from a course on Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy.

      At ESA this year, I gave a talk in a symposium about changing the culture of ecology. The talk was entitled Taking the Ecological Conversation Online and summarized what I thought were the benefits of engaging in online activities. As this was a scientific audience interested in how we might change the culture of Ecology to improve our science, I focused the talk not on what I feel are the outreach &amp; public engagement benefits of going online - those are both obvious and legion.

      ALl right - here&rsquo;s my Thursday schedule (mostly for myself so I can keep track of it on my phone). I think in the morning, I just might park myself in the session on climate change &amp; communities as one of my main interests for this meeting is&hellip;climate change and communities. Also, I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll fill in the lower right hand side of my bingo card (although I already got Bingo today on the lower line&hellip;)

      Tuesday looks to be pretty exciting. The number of overlapping talks all of which I want to see has jumped up, and, heck, there are overlapping symposia that I could sit through. That said, I THINK this is going to be my schedule&hellip;again, just posting it for myself, but feel free to browse (loading this page on ye olde smartphone and using it to navigate was wicked convenient today).
If there is one talk to see today, in my opinion, it&rsquo;s the 10:50 COS 36-9 talk by Pamela Reynolds.

      After the fantastic NCEAS working group on the future of scholarly publishing in EEB (big success - stay tuned for more news on that front!), I participated in a really interesting online discussion about Post-Publication peer review with Carl Boettiger, Jamie Ashlander, and Scott Chamberlain. The conversation was great, and I think brought up a lot of interesting points - both that echoed some discussions in our group and went far beyond them.

      A service that is travelling along similar lines of what I&rsquo;m interested in for open publishing has launched today. PeerJ is being pitched as a cross between PLoS ONE and arXiv and indeed the company was founded by former PLoS ONE and Mendeley folk. It&rsquo;s an interesting model where authors signup with a pre-paid plan. $99 gets you unlimited public preprints and 1 peer reviewed paper per year. $169 adds unlimited private preprints and another paper per year.

      SciFund Round 2 is now complete, and it pulled in $100,345 for science! 43% of the projects achieved 100% or more of their goal - almost double of round 1 - and 60% of all funds asked for were secured. Numerous projects that didn&rsquo;t fully reach their goal were above 80%. A TON of great research is going to come out of this, and I am excited!
Science crowdfunding continues to grow as a viable source of research fund.

      Happy Friday, everyone. To celebrate the end of the week, I leave you with what is hands down my favorite #SciFund video from round 2. And I don&rsquo;t just say this because it was made by a collaborator of mine of the #SciFund paper that we happen to be editing right this very moment (or, in half an hour or so). I say this because it is a beautiful example of the fusion of (silly) Art and Science.

      Climate change is speeding up the timing of plants growing &amp; flowering. It&rsquo;s an old trope we&rsquo;re all used to hearing by now. Spring warms up earlier, and plants shift their timing - their phenology. This shift in phenology is going to have big consequences for things like agricultural production, the ability for wildlife to find food, the ski season, etc. Important, right? Something we might want to predict. So, we&rsquo;ve been running experiments for years, looking at climate change scenarios, and finding out how much earlier plants will do their thing, and we&rsquo;ve gotten some pretty good results.

      Just over a year and a half ago, I was lucky enough to be in a room with some of the world&rsquo;s top authorities on the consequences of species loss at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. We were worried. When Brad Cardinale asked, &ldquo;So, where does diversity loss rank? As important as climate change? Rampant nutrient runoff from agriculture? I mean, come on, how important is it, really?

      I just saw this video from the Pawlik lab doing work done in the Aquarius habitat in the Caribbean. I just adore it. There&rsquo;s something about the lighthearted sense of fund and enjoyment behind the soundtrack that syncs up with the work that&rsquo;s being done that captures some of the essence of what subtidal work can be (even for those of us in colder temperate climes). Enjoy this research pastiche!

      Does Synthesis Ecology exist? Is it a discipline? If so, what is it? If not, why not?
As a part of the Trends in Ecological Analysis and Synthesis symposium here at NCEAS, several postdocs past and present organized by Jennifer &ldquo;Firestarter&rdquo; Balch got together and sent this survey to the last 15 years of NCEAS postdocs. The survey asks what current and former NCEAS postdocs thought were the most important contributions in Synthesis Ecology and what they thought were the most exciting future directions in Synthesis Ecology.

      I&rsquo;ve been pretty stoked about the This is What a Scientist Looks Like project on tumblr. So much so that I felt compelled to submit an (old) photo of me doing field work. I mean, when one things science, they often think labcoats and microscopes. When one thinks ecology, they often think hiking in a forest or working out on a sunny grassland. (note: these are impressions I&rsquo;ve gotten to people when I say these words - not what I think myself, natch.

      That&rsquo;s right, folk, last time we had 49 scientists bring in ~1400 people to check out their hot science and fund it to the tune of $76,000. And that was when we had no idea what we were doing. And now it&rsquo;s time for round 2! We&rsquo;re going to have a little more community review, some training, and we have a whole boatload of lessons learned.
So if you&rsquo;re a scientist who wants to crowdfund their research, go and sign up!

      Friday&rsquo;s NCEAS discussion about changing the future of scientific publishing was fascinating. We had a wide variety of views about the current system, what it&rsquo;s adding to our papers, if the problems really are problems, and why we got here. But there was one thing that came up again and again, that even the most skeptical status quo folk in the crowd agreed was where the true value of the current journal system lies -

      Today at The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis we&rsquo;re having an open discussion about the future of scholarly publishing. I may post some notes from it later, but, Stephanie Pau and I have compiled a list of thought questions and helpful links to help folk prep. And, as it was an interesting gathering of linkage, I thought it mide be useful more broadly. So, below is the text of my email and the useful links.

      We know that warming, storms, drought, acidification, and the myriad of other effects of climate change will impact natural ecosystems. Most of our studies have concentrated on direct effects, though. For example, if you change temperature, you alter herbivore grazing rates. But what about indirect effects? For example, I&rsquo;ve found that increased intense storm frequency may remove kelp which will have an indirect effect on the structure of kelp forest food webs.

      In many ways, the Research Works Act has been a blessing (see excellent link round up here). It has taken the moderately complacent but always grousing scientific community and whipped our feelings about the current state and cost of scientific publishing into a white hot fury. Ideas are bandied about, critiques given, and people begin to take action.
So what is the way forward? Certainly we are not getting away from journals in the near term.

      I have long used JAGS to do all of my Bayesian work on my mac. Early on, I tried to figure out how to install WinBUGS and OpenBUGS and their accompanying R libraries on my mac, but, to no avail. I just had too hard of a time getting them running and gave up.
But, it would seem that some things have changed with Wine lately, and it is now possible to not only get WinBUGS itself running nicely on a mac, but to also get R2WinBUGS to run as well.

      This is part of a larger series of open notebook posts about how food web structure modifies the effects of predator extinctions. For an introduction and list of other posts, see here.
OK, last but on two-level food webs for the moment. I&rsquo;ve examined how food web structure can change the effects of predator or prey extinctions on both top-down and bottom-up control. A number of folk (including me) have theorized that changes in diversity at two trophic levels should interact - that the consequences of predator diversity loss should change as prey species are lost.

OK, only two more entries (I think) on simple two-level food webs before we jump into the great unkown (and you&rsquo;ll see how unknown it is). So far I&rsquo;ve been talking about the consequences of losing predator species for predation and energy transfer.

So, in my last post (notebook entry?), I introduced a new framework for understanding how the food web structure of a predator-prey food web can affect the consequences of extinction for the ability of predators to control their prey.

To begin tackling the question of &ldquo;How does the structure of a food web influence the consequences of extinction? let&rsquo;s begin by thinking about how changes in the number of predator species in a simple 2-level predator-prey food web can influence 1) the probability of prey being eaten and 2) the amount of energy transfered to the predator group.

      After 45 days, with $76,230 raised from 1440 people, I am a pretty proud papa.
My own project hit 70% bringing in $4,600 for kelp forest research. While not complete, it funds one full round of sampling trips and a little extra, so, I&rsquo;m super excited! And now the data from RocketHub and #SciFund participants begins to flow in. Time to start doing some analyses on what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and begin to lay out the future of crowdfunding in science!

      So, we know that species are going extinct at a pretty stunning rate. Mostly by human activities. The natural question is, will this affect the function of the natural world? You may well say &lsquo;Duh! Of course!&rsquo; as a first instinctive pass, but, the issue isn&rsquo;t so clear cut - will species that survive simply take up the slack? What&rsquo;s the value of a &lsquo;species&rsquo; anyway?
Starting in the late &rsquo;90s the field of diversity-function research has tackled this topic, largely using manipulations plant species number.

      I&rsquo;m so excited. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite times of year. That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s time for the Annual Chemical Ecology Music Video Festival! Oh, J. Long, what have your students cooked up this time?
Pure awesomeness, that&rsquo;s what. This year&rsquo;s crop features a number of epic ballads, rap superstars, and more. I think I&rsquo;ll highlight my current two favorites, but you should definitely go check out the whole bunch or go back and revisit last year&rsquo;s (particularly Under the Boat (featuring K.

      So, I&rsquo;ve been getting some questions about how one can make their own Yeti-crabs-dance-to-music video. So here&rsquo;s a quick guide for the interested folk who haven&rsquo;t played around with audio or video before but want to try it out. So, here&rsquo;s what I did, step-by-step, in 9 easy steps. All told, this took me, eh, 5 minutes.
(This is for iMovie, and I&rsquo;ll link to a few tutorials in case you need them.

      Several years ago, when the Yeti crab, Kiwa hirsuta was first described, the world looked at a crustacean for the first time and went, &ldquo;AWWWWW!!!&rdquo;
I mean, how could you know love crabs from the Kiwa genus? They have fuzzy arms! And are adorable! People immediately began paying tribute with plush toys of all manner and even decorative food arrangements.
So what could be better than a plain ole&rsquo; Yeti crab?

      I admit it. I love big scientific meetings. There&rsquo;s something about the intense intellectual hubbub of thousands of my fields greatest minds gathered in one place for a few days of showing off the latest, greatest, flashiest work that just fills me with joy. Also a need to sleep for a week afterwards due to my brain going at a Matrix-like pace to keep up with all of the new and interesting information while spouting off ideas, critiques, beginning collaborations, and constantly questing to understand the growing shape of the research fields that interest me.

      I am part of an incredibly exciting project - the #SciFund Challenge. #SciFund is an attempt to have scientists link their work to the general public through crowdfunding. As I&rsquo;m one of the organizers, I thought I should have some skin in the game. But what skin?
Well, people are pitching some incredibly sexy projects - tracking puffin migrations, coral reefs conservation,snake-squirrel interactions (WITH ROBOSQUIRRELS!), mathematical modeling of movements like Occupy Wall Street, and many many more.

      Whew, it&rsquo;s been a bit since I posted here. Rest assured, little sea squirts, there are some interesting new things in the works. Some things that are science-y (in which I try and use this blog as a sounding board/ lab notebook) and some things not so much.
In the not so much category, a ton of my time has lately been going to the organizing of the #SciFund challenge - a large initiative to try and crowdfunding for science!

      Yesterday, we lost a great innovator and someone who, even if unwittingly, has really helped science. I am a passionate Mac advocate. It&rsquo;s blend of good user interface with a UNIX underpinning lets many of us just concentrate on our work rather than constantly dithering with niggling details. So, I&rsquo;m going to offer up this picture as my tribute. It&rsquo;s a pic of me back from my first field season when I was doing photo sampling in Monterey Bay and would have to download the files in between dives due to flash cards maxing out below 1gig in those days.

      I can only assume that the authors of the every silly Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal have taken invertebrate zoology and were fascinated by the bizarre life history cycles of trematodes and/or spent some time hanging around with Armand Kuris and Kevin Lafferty at UC Santa Barbara. Why? Because of today&rsquo;s brilliant comic (see below).

Update: apparently the author&rsquo;s wife is IN the Kuris lab. Ha!

      There have been a steady stream of articles over the years stating that now is the time for Science to embrace Crowdfunding. It is the wave of the future, they state. It will link people to science directly. Abandon the shackles of the NSF and NIH, ye meek and mild mannered scientists. The internet is your salvation.
And along with this hoopla comes a small handfull of science crowdfunding sites, but few success stories.

I mean, if you&rsquo;re going to go Tux (and I do so love a good tuxedo), cufflinks are a must. But what kind of cufflinks should a gentleman marine biologist wear? Why, sea-creature themed, of course.

Woohoo!
So, what have I been doing for the past few years of my life?
In brief summary: Kelp. Food webs. Climate change. A potent combination.
And if you want the punchline without digging into the rest of this article, it is this: the diverse, complex food webs of southern California kelp forest will likely be greatly simplified if climate change leads to big storms every year.

      One of the main reasons science blogs excite me is the possibility of communication between scientists. It allows for a medium that scientists can use to hash out ideas and do so publicly. This has the added advantage that those who are not big names in a field or somesuch can listen in, as it were, or even step in and participate.
The discussion of science between scientists here, online, also has the added advantage of allowing the public to see inside of scientific debates and discussions in realtime.

      I&rsquo;m a HUGE fan of Structural Equation Modeling. For those of you unfamiliar with the technique, it&rsquo;s awesome for three main reasons.
  It&rsquo;s a method of teasing apart direct and indirect interactions in your data.
  It allows you to assess the importance of underlying latent variables that you cannot measure, but for which have measured indicators.
  As it&rsquo;s formally presented, with path diagrams showing connections between variables, it&rsquo;s SUPER easy to link conceptual models with your data.

      The more I use it, the deeper I fall in love with ggplot2. I know, some of you have heard me kvel about it ad nauseum (oh, yiddish and latin in one sentence - extra points!). But the graphs really look great, and once you wrap your head around a few concepts, it&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to make it do most anything you want.
Except for one thing.
One thing I loved about the old R plotting functions was the ability to setup panels easily, and fill them with totally different graphs.

      WARNING: This blog entry contains me awkwardly groping with math. It&rsquo;s not pretty. It&rsquo;s not done elegantly - indeed, for problems of even moderate complexity I fired up maxima (which is totally awesome!) rather than screw up the algebra on paper. And there are a few leaps that I make that I&rsquo;m sure someone could write a proof for, but, well&hellip; While I fall somewhere in the middle of the theoretical - experimental axis of scientists, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s something I do every day, so, expect some turbulence.

      Geological time has witnessed 5 extinction crises. Now we&rsquo;re in the middle of the 6th - this time driven by man. What&rsquo;s unprecedented, however, is the rate we are driving species extinct. For many taxa, it&rsquo;s faster than we&rsquo;ve seen in geological time (see here for discussion).
So? Will vast reductions in the diversity of species on earth matter? I mean, heck, maybe we only need two or three of each taxa, and we&rsquo;re all good.

      I woke up this morning to a wonderful email in my inbox (thanks, Fergus!) letting me know about a little musical delight. A song about diurnal zooplankton migration entitled, well, Diurnal Migration. With lyrics like Much of the ocean is not yet explored/ Though submarines pootle about the sea floor, how can you go wrong? (Also, I now have an image of Dr. M. pootling about the seafloor).
So, I went on and decided to listen to the rest of the album, Pre-Apocalyptic Love Song, by Hannah Werdmuller, an ecologist-singer-songwriter.

      Thanks to Jim, I&rsquo;ve been using R in the shell more and more - in concert with vi. It&rsquo;s been fun, and nice to integrate my workflows all on the server (although I haven&rsquo;t had to do much graphing yet - I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll start kvetching then and return to a nice gui).
One thing that has frustrated me is that large dumps of output - say, a list composed of elements that are 100 lines each - just whip past me without an ability to scroll through more slowly.

So go out there, and celebrate the fact that you&rsquo;re halfway to the day where you can make 2 Pi!
(And don&rsquo;t worry, you should still make some π today! It&rsquo;s delicious!)

      I&rsquo;ll admit it. There&rsquo;s one thing that always makes me sad working on a mac. R. How does R make me sad on a mac? I look over at my compatriots in Windows using fun Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Tinn-R, and I sigh. On the other hand, I just had the sad little text editor and shell. Sure, it was enough, and I had wrung some sweet sweet code from that simple setup, but windows would get lost, I&rsquo;d lose track of what file was where, what plot window was open, and would sometimes even forget which instance of R I was working in when I was working on two projects at the same time (one for simulation, one for analysis).

      For the past three years, the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America has hosted a wonderful entitled &ldquo;Ecology on the Web&rdquo;. Under the curation of Jeff Hollister, EoW started out and grew to provide a number of links to fantastic ecological projects on the web.
If you&rsquo;re reading this, you know that using the internet as a medium to facilitate communication between scientists is a passion of mine. So I was delighted when Jeff asked me to take over the feature.

My first post is up where I discuss some of my work on How are extinctions and invasions shaping food webs?
Also, contrary to what Rick may have you believe, I&rsquo;m at NCEAS, not NESCent.

      Sometimes, this blog is about pure science. But lately, it appears I&rsquo;ll be cataloging the increasing boom in Science related music videos. Because they&rsquo;re awesome.
So be it.
The latest to be sent to my inbox (h/t Jenn Williams) is the Ecological Dynamics Rap made for Tom Wessel&lsquo;s Ecological Dynamics of Landscapes.

      Last October, Colin Bates and Jeff Morales conducted a workshop on Scientific Filmmaking at my old stomping grounds, the Bodega Marine Lab. The two run an awesome organization whose sole mission is to train people in ways to tell compelling science stories via video. As someone who has worked on a scientific documentary before, film is an incredible medium to have science make a direct connection with the public. So hats off to them.

      OK - has this ever happened to you? You are working with a team of collaborators all using a common dataset - maybe from an Agency, and LTER, or someone else&rsquo;s data altogether. Each of you has some task - incorporating new data, running fancy models and putting the results back into the data for later analysis, etc.
Months later you come back, ready to put it all together to execute your master plan of analysis, when suddenly you realize that you&rsquo;ve all been working on slightly different versions of the original dataset.

      Hey! I&rsquo;m in a book! For kids! Best of all, its&rsquo; a chapter to help kids get excited about marine science. I got hooked into the world of marine biology young, and have never looked back. I mean - The ocean! Sea life! It&rsquo;s awesome!
So, I was delighted when Alisa Weinstein asked me a few years ago to contribute to her Earn My Keep project. The basic premise of the project is that we want our kids to learn about some of the interesting jobs and professions out there in the real world.

      How is fishing changing the ocean? This simple question has motivated a slew of fantastic research. One of the most pervasive ideas has been that of Fishing Down Marine Food Webs. Popularized by Daniel Pauly and colleagues in their 1998 paper, the idea simply states that when humans began fishing, we hit the top predators first. Gradually, as we depleted those stocks, human fishing moved down to the next trophic level.

      Let&rsquo;s face it. The current journal system is slowly breaking down - in Ecology if not in other disciplines as well. The number of submissions is going up exponentially. At the same time, journals are finding it harder and harder to find reviewers. Statistics such as editors contacting 10 reviewers to find 3 are not uncommon. People don&rsquo;t respond, they take a long time to review, or just take a long time and THEN don&rsquo;t respond leading to a need for still more reviewers to be found (this has held up 2 of my pubs for 3+ extra months).

Where is in the Gulf of Mexico.
And right before your work really takes flight, the Deepwater Horizon happens.
(add to that that one of you is taking some course from some silly guy on this thing called structural equation modeling - why would you ever do that?

Tunicate Whiskey.
To wit, hollow out one Halocynthia roretzi. Fill tunic with Soju (korean whiskey). Drink.
For some reason, I think this would work really well with Laphroaig or other Islay malts. Or, perhaps, give that nice Islay character to something more generic - spice up your Johnny walker with a little Styela.
On second thought, a big Styela is about the size of a shot glass&hellip;

If you&rsquo;re like me, when you learned experimental stats, you were taught to worship at the throne of the Normal Distribution. Always check your data and make sure it is normally distributed! Or, make sure that whatever lines you fit to it have normally distributed error around them!

      I recently attended the DISCCRS symposium for recent PhDs of a wide variety of disciplines whose work (past or present) deals with climate change. The week-long meeting was phenomenal, seeding me with thoughts, ideas, and basically making me feel quite good about the work I&rsquo;m doing (if also very pessimistic about how society is dealing with Climate Change). Perhaps one of the most interesting exercises of the whole thing was something we had to do as a sort of getting-to-know-you.

      Climate change. It&rsquo;s going to wreak no small amount of havoc on mother nature (and if you&rsquo;re reading this but think all of this climate change stuff is poppycock, please visit Skeptical Science and then come back). How good of a guide is our intuition for what will happen?
This is a great question when it comes to predator-prey relationships and the food chain. One may well think that, heck, from first principles we know that adding heat to a system speeds things up.

      Why does it take so long for awesome cutting-edge statistical to make their way over to ecology? There are a myriad of techniques out there that have been around for 20, 30, 40, or more years that could help so many ecologists from banging their head into a wall over and over and over and&hellip;well, you get the point. But, it takes quite a while for them to percolate over to us.

 Significant p-values. For so many scientists using statistics, this is your lord. Your master. Heck, it has its own facebook group filed under religious affiliations (ok, so, maybe I created that.) And it is a concept to whose slavish devotion we may have sacrificed a good bit of forward progress in science over the past half century. Time to blow up the cathedral! Or so says Stuart Hurlbert and Celia Lombardi in a recent fascinating review.

One of those &ldquo;I have a meeting that will finalize the analyses for a paper, let&rsquo;s just check that ONE thing that didn&rsquo;t matter in early versions of this model, so, it shouldn&rsquo;t matter now, and OMGWTFBBQ everything changed!&rdquo; kinds of days.

      Every so often, a conservation problem rears its head that, upon reflection, we realize we had some inkling of even decades ago. Global warming, biofuels, overfishing, etc. The information was there, but scarce, buried in obscurity, or seemingly counterintuitive. Why not try and recognize the crucial questions early, before the lobster is out of the trap, so to speak? (What, I&rsquo;m a marine biologist!)
Businesses has recognized the need to spot emerging trends with scant information and regularly engages in an exercise called Horizon Scanning.

Um. I think that describes my research program. Except the whole isotope/bar-coding thing. Damn. Add that to the list of things I need to learn, as right now, figuring out who-eats-who can be a real show-stopper! But overall, I guess I&rsquo;m on the right track.

      Here at the Santa Barbara Farmer&rsquo;s market, I&rsquo;ve been delighted that we have local fish, ridgeback shrimp, mussels, and oysters. They&rsquo;re amongst the tastiest seafood I&rsquo;ve eaten (last week&rsquo;s pumpkin shrimp risotto that I whipped up was one of the all time most amazing things I&rsquo;ve ever cooked).
One thing I&rsquo;ve always admired is that the lovely fresh seasonal sustainably farmed veggies one can get at the farmers market can also be purchased via a Community Supported Agriculture organization.

      As a young tyke growing up around the decaying maritime glories of Baltimore, I was lucky to sail aboard The Lady Maryland. The feel and scent of her wooden decks, polished brass, and wet wool still haunt me, actually. Those voyages were coupled with a feisty choir teacher, John &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Merrill, who taught me my first few Sea Chanties. (and we all know where that led&hellip;)
While I loved the marine world from a deeply emotional place at the time (my Aunt had been an underwater photographer before passing away), and loved science because, let&rsquo;s face it, I was an enormous nerd, Tall Ships and Sea Chanties are what made me fall in love with The Sea.

      Science is a giant family. Each Professor gives &ldquo;birth&rdquo; to a litter of PhD students over time, many of whom go on to have their own students, who have their own students, and so on and so forth ad infinitum.
While all of us know our academic parent (right?), at least some of our sciblings (depending on the age of the lab), and usually our academic grandparent, what about our great-grandparent?

      I just learned that Lawrence Slobodkin passed away last week. Slobodkin was one of the authors of the infamous HSS paper in 1960 that has shaped how we think of the role of predators in ecosystems for decades. Indeed, it is one of the very origins of the modern concept of trophic cascades. More than that, though, this was a man with broad ranging interests in biology. I think the New York Times Obit has some interesting points about his contribution to our understanding of the world, and includes this quote from Slobodkin:

      This is tremendously cool. A nice intuitive web-based interface for the lme4 package in R (and you neither need to know R or understand the intricacies of the lme4 package) that gives you pdf output and plots. If you just want to play around and not worry about coding things up, it&rsquo;s a great little option. Be sure to check out the demo video.

      As an ecologist working in temperate climes, I&rsquo;ve been following the ocean acidification field with some interest. It&rsquo;s always been obvious to me how acidification has enormous ramifications for coral reefs and other tropical marine ecosystems. They exist in warm waters already, often close to their thermal maxima. Acidifying the water around them at any creatures using calcium carbonate seems like a recipe for disaster.

      I&rsquo;m back for another pean to ANOVA-loving experimental ecology. Barplots (or point-range plots - but which is better is a discussion for a different time) are the thing! And a friend of mine was recently asking me how to do a decent barplot with ggplot2 for data of moderate complexity (e.g., a 2-way ANOVA).
So I tried it.
And then I hit my head against a wall for a little while.

Tres cool.
The LTER network, for those unfamiliar, is perhaps the oldest network of Long Term Ecological Research projects, well, anywhere.

      There is nothing like that pain of taking a first look at fresh precious new data from a carefully designed experiment which took months of planning and construction, 8 divers working full days, and a lot of back-and-forth with colleagues, and then you find absolutely no patterns of interest.
Yup, it&rsquo;s a real takes-your-breath-away-hand-me-a-beer kind of moment. Fortunately, I was on my way to a 4th of July dinner with my family up in the mountains of Colorado, so, I wasn&rsquo;t quite going to commit hari-kari on the spot.

      I haven&rsquo;t posted anything about R-nerdery in quite some time. But I have to pause for a moment, and sing the praises of a relatively new package that has made my life exponentially easier. The plyr package.
R has the capability to apply a single function to a vector or list using apply or mapply, or their various derivatives. This returns another vector or list.
This is great in principal, but in practice, with indexing, odd return objects, and difficulties in using multiple arguments, it can get out of hand for complex functions.

      I love modeling! I love modeling! Modeling will solve everything!
Let&rsquo;s model the spatial distribution of Bigfoot!
WAIT, WHAT?!
Figure 1 from the paper. Foots denote sighting of Sasquatch footprints. Circles for just visual/auditory sightings. I ask, how does one know what Bigfoot sounds like?
Yes, it sounds silly, but in the current issue of the Journal of Biogegraphy, Lozier et al give us their stunning contribution Predicting the distribution of Sasquatch in western North America: anything goes with ecological niche modelling.

      Yes, it&rsquo;s time for squirts to take the limelight in America&rsquo;s most fashionable magazine! I know this is a little old, but in the 2007 article, If You Knew Sushi by Nick Tosches, the author encounters a delicacy, Halocynthia roretzi aka the Sea Pineapple. (That&rsquo;s right, they&rsquo;re even on wikipedia now!)
&ldquo;Sea pineapple,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Attaches to rocks in the ocean. Tastes something like iodine. Sendai people like it.&rdquo;
It looks nothing like a pineapple.

      For the fashionable marine biologist: Some months back, I fell upon a website called Sir Critter selling t-shirts of organisms bedecked by a monocle, top-hats, and cane. I asked the designer if he would create a Sir Sea Squirt. He was delighted, and just posted the resulting shirt, Sir Sea Squirt.

For those of you out there who don&rsquo;t think Sea Squirts are, indeed, the coolest thing on earth. ahem They also have Sir Urchin (I&rsquo;m getting one with a purple S.

      There&rsquo;s nothing so satisfying as pulling back and seeing your brand new experiment out there in the water.
It&rsquo;s been a crazy week or three getting this up and running, but now my first big postdoctoral experiment is soaking in the water, with urchins grazing away.
I&rsquo;m testing some ideas regarding how diversity mediates the impact of disturbance by urchin grazing, and vice-versa - how disturbance by grazing can alter diversity.

      I&rsquo;ve gotta, say, Roughgarden&rsquo;s The Genial Gene is so far pretty awesome. It is fulfilling its promise of being meaty, laying out the real some real testable predictions for her theory of Social Selection, and also pointing out some of the logical, historical, and cultural fallacies of sexual selection. I&rsquo;m going to be very curious to read some of the reviews that will come out by sexual selection advocates, but so far, I think she is presenting a fairly compelling argument.

      Recently on ecolog-l, there has been a thread going around about journal publishing - open access v. pay-for access, impact factor, elitism, reviewing, etc. The central question seems to be, is the publication system somehow broken? Do we need to fix it? Is the model of journals such as PLoS Biology or The Open Ecology Journal not enough?
I think the answer is that in the realm of experimental or solid theoretical work, yes, the open access model of science publishing is alive and well (although I often wished that more of the journals out there, such as Research Letters in Ecology, got more attention - but the question of why to submit in a new journal, and what makes a journal high on ones priority list is a whole different ball of wax).

      Lately, I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of webs.
I&rsquo;ve been asking myself, how do we visualize the hidden complexity of the natural world? This is not an idle question, but draws on some of my current research. It is vital to how we think about ecosystems when we attempt to preserve and restore them. It is inherently beautiful, in and of itself.
Most of us are familiar with the concept of a food chain.

      A few years back, I read Evolution&rsquo;s Rainbow by Joan Roughgarden, and was a huge fan. In it, she builds a compelling argument that sex and gender are two different independently assorting quantitative genetic trains. I.e., Your sex (anatomy) and gender (behavior and sexuality)? Not actually the same thing. Also, not binary. Both (yes, sex, too) are continuous traits.
She builds a strong case for this both based on the wild variety of mating strategies out in nature (and shows how they don&rsquo;t really fit into the binary gender paradigm of sexual selection) and even more thoroughly through human biology and history.

      The &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; experimental design for asking how do changes in biodiversity change ecosystem function has been to randomly assemble communities of varying species richness, but equal abundance, and examining differences in function from one level of richness to the next.
But let&rsquo;s be honest. Changes in diversity due to impacts by man will not be random. In many ways, the early (and much maligned) designs of Tilman and colleagues are really more relevant to realistic biodiversity change scenarios than random assembly experiments.

And I can think of a myriad of field science/twitter uses:

Curious about what some of the legends in the field of taxonomy were writing when they were undergraduates? Want to track down every single fish gut contents record in the Pacific Northwest for the last century?

Now I&rsquo;ve heard it all before, but there&rsquo;s something about these bizarre little trinkets that is both beautiful, and could really wake up an invert zoo class full of sleepy students. It even has the obligatory barnacle video.

      And now its time for a multivariate stats geek out.
The statistics that we use determine the inferences we draw from our data. The more statistical tools you learn to use, the more likely you are likely to slip on a loose bit of data, and stab yourself in the eyeball with your swiss-army-knife of p values. It&rsquo;s happened to all of us, and it is rarely due to willful misconduct.

      Attention tunicate nerds! The Proceedings of the 2nd International Invasive Sea Squirt Symposium (I love that name) (and, OK, it&rsquo;s Conference, not Symposium, but how could I resist renaming it to something more fun!) are now online! And there&rsquo;s a lot there to check out.

      Sometimes, the devil IS in the details. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about feedbacks between community community structure and function lately, and run into a few curious roadblocks, as well as one very very interesting story.
First, the roadblocks. Just what do we mean by structure and function, particularly in reference to a biological community? Structure seems obvious - the static properties of a biological system that we can go out, stare at, and say,&ldquo;Oh, yes, hello structure!

      For those who need just the right holiday card for that certain someone, The Rhinobird has an excellent collection of holiday cards using the images of Ernst Haeckel for purchase at cafepress! Who knew a jellyfish could be so festive!
Sadly, no Aurelia dreidels. Or ascidians. (hrmph!) Maybe next time.

      So, what am I up to? Where&rsquo;s my research program going? What occupied my mind these days? I think cephalopodcast may have answered some of this with a recent post in which they linked the following movie.

      Just a quick note - after leaving Davis, the server for this blog went down. This is the new home (like the domain name?)
The old content will be back once I get the old server in the mail. In the meantime, I have returned! New content soon&hellip;

      As I am in the thick of job hunting season, I&rsquo;m writing a few applications. One of the most interesting parts of the whole process is the research statement. It&rsquo;s interesting as it forces one to really be self-reflective, and ask &ldquo;Who am I and why am I doing this?&rdquo; The first paragraph in particular is a sort of declaration. Hopefully this will be the last one of these I write, but, who am I kidding.
